RESOLVED to this end to eliminate progressively the obstacles to substantially all their trade, in accordance with the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade concerning the establishment of free trade areas,
DECLARING their readiness to examine, in the light of any relevant factor, and in particular of developments in the Community, the possibility of developing and deepening their relations where it would appear to be useful in the interests of their economies to extend them to fields not covered by this Agreement,

4. The reduced duties calculated in accordance with this Article and Protocol No 1 shall be applied rounded to the first decimal place.

1. Each Contracting Party reserves the right to refuse to recognize the validity of the approval of road vehicles or containers which do not meet the conditions set forth in Articles 12 and 13 above.

The provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall not prevent a Contracting Party from requiring the fulfilment at the customs office of destination of formalities laid down by its national regulations to ensure that, once the TIR operation has been completed, the road vehicle, the combination of vehicles or the container will be re-exported.
When a road vehicle or combination of vehicles is carrying out a TIR operation, one rectangular plate bearing the inscription "TIR" and conforming to the specifications given in Annex 5 to this Convention shall be affixed to the front and another to the rear of the road vehicle or combination of vehicles. These plates shall be so placed as to be clearly visible and shall be removable.
1. A single TIR carnet shall be made out in respect of each road vehicle or container. However, a single TIR carnet may be made out in respect of a combination of vehicles or for several containers loaded on to a single road vehicle or on to a combination of vehicles.

For journeys in the territory of their country, the customs authorities may fix a time limit and require the road vehicle, the combination of vehicles or the container to follow a prescribed route.
At each customs office en route and at customs offices of destination, the road vehicle, the combination of vehicles or the container shall be produced for purposes of control to the customs authorities together with the load and the TIR carnet relating thereto.
1. As a general rule and except when they examine the goods in accordance with Article 5 (2), the customs authorities of the customs offices en route of each of the Contracting Parties shall accept the customs seals of other Contracting Parties, provided that they are intact. The said customs authorities may, however, if control requirements make it necessary, add their own seals.
2. The customs seals thus accepted by a Contracting Party shall have in the territory of that Contracting Party the benefit of the same legal protection as is accorded to the national seals.

If the customs seals are broken en route otherwise than in the circumstances of Articles 24 and 35, or if any goods are destroyed or damaged without breaking of such seals, the procedure laid down in Annex 1 to this Convention for the use of the TIR carnet shall, without prejudice to the possible application of the provisions of national law, be followed, and the certified report in the TIR carnet shall be completed.
1. When transport under cover of a TIR carnet takes place in part in the territory of a State which is not a Contracting Party to this Convention, the TIR operation shall be suspended during that part of the journey. In that case, the customs authorities of the Contracting Party on whose territory the journey continues shall accept the TIR carnet for the resumption of the TIR operation, provided that the customs seals and/or identifying marks have remained intact.
2. The same shall apply where for a part of the journey the TIR carnet is not used by the holder of the carnet in the territory of a Contracting Party because of the existence of simpler customs transit procedures or when the use of a customs transit regime is not necessary.
3. In such cases the customs offices where the TIR operation is suspended or resumed shall be deemed to be customs offices of exit en route and customs offices of entry en route respectively.
Subject to the provisions of this Convention, and in particular Article 18, another customs office of destination may he substituted for a customs office of destination originally indicated.
On arrival of the load at the customs office of destination, and provided that the goods are then placed under another system of customs control or are cleared for home use, discharge of the TIR carnet shall take place without delay.
(c) Provisions concerning transport of heavy or bulky goods
1. The provisions of this section apply only to the transport of heavy or bulky goods as defined in Article 1 (k) of this Convention.
2. Where the provisions of this section apply, heavy or bulky goods may, if the authorities at the customs office of departure so decide, be carried by means of non-sealed vehicles or containers.

All the provisions of this Convention, save those to which the special provisions of this section make an exception, shall apply to the transport of heavy or bulky goods under the TIR procedure.

The authorities at the customs offices en route of each of the Contracting Parties shall accept the customs seals and/or identifying marks affixed by the competent authorities of other Contracting Parties. They may, however, affix additional seals and/or identifying marks ; they shall record particulars of the new seals and/or identifying marks on the vouchers of the TIR carnet used in their country, on the corresponding counterfoils and on the vouchers remaining in the TIR carnet.
If customs authorities conducting an examination of the load at a customs office en route or in the course of the journey are obliged to break seals and/or remove identifying marks, they shall record the new seals and/or identifying marks on the vouchers of the TIR carnet, used in their country, on the corresponding counterfoils and on the vouchers remaining in the TIR carnet.

The customs administrations of the countries of departure and of destination shall not consider the holder of the TIR carnet responsible for the discrepancies which may be discovered in those countries, when the discrepancies in fact relate to the customs procedures which preceded or followed a TIR operation and in which the holder was not involved.
When it is established to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that goods specified on the manifest of a TIR carnet have been destroyed or have been irrecoverably lost by accident or force majeure or that they are short by reason of their nature, payment of the duties and taxes normally due shall be waived.
On receipt from a Contracting Party of a request giving the relevant reasons, the competent authorities of the Contracting Parties concerned in a TIR operation shall furnish that Contracting Party with all available information needed for implementation of the provisions of Articles 39, 40 and 41 above.

(b) In order to implement the abovementioned decision the EEC has requested the Association to administer for them a special account (Special Action Account) in the aggregate amount of the equivalent of 385 million dollars, to be kept separate and apart from all other accounts and assets of the Association and to be used for credits (Special Action Credits) in amounts which will be additional, in respect of both programme and project lending, to the amount of the Association's planned programme for the period of commitment of the Special Action Account for each country eligible to receive them and otherwise on the basis set forth below;
(c) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States, and the Association shall use its best efforts to assure, that the entire amount to be contributed by the Member States be committed within six months from the effective date of the Agreement and disbursed on credits as far as possible within two years from the effective date;
(d) The EEC and the Association have consulted regarding the proposed implementation and administration of this Agreement and the commitment of funds to assure a broad and balanced geographical distribution thereunder. To that end the Association has furnished the EEC with a table showing the manner in which it would propose to apply the criteria set forth in this Agreement;
NOW THEREFORE, THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE AS FOLLOWS:
Establishment and administration of the Special Action Account
There is hereby established by the Association a special account entitled "Special Action Account" constituted by the monies which the Member States shall contribute to the Special Action Account in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement which shall be held in trust and used by the Association, acting as administrator (the Association acting in that capacity is hereinafter referred to as the administrator) only for the purpose of, and in accordance with, the provisions of this Agreement. The Special Action Account shall be kept separate and apart from all other accounts and assets of the Association.
(b) Payment shall be made in two instalments: (i) the first, consisting of at least 45 % of each contribution, shall be made within 30 days after the effective date of this Agreement, or such other date as may be agreed between the EEC and the administrator;
(ii) the second, consisting of the balance of the contribution, shall be made by 1 January 1979 or such other date as may be agreed between the EEC and the administrator taking account of the time necessary for parliamentary approval of the annual budgets.
(c) Any Member State which so wishes may make its payments more rapidly than as indicated above.
The administrator shall draw on the cash or notes on an approximately pro rata basis in accordance with the Association's normal procedures in order to meet disbursements of Special Action Credits and to maintain a reasonable working balance in the Special Action Account.
Utilization of Special Action Account
(ii) the extent to which the country concerned depends on official development assistance for its external capital resources;
(iii) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the current and prospective economic problems of the country;
(iv) developments in and prospects for the country's export earnings;
(v) the capacity of the country to import goods essential to the development process;
(vii) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned are likely to be met by contributions from other sources.
Each Special Action Credit shall be made for the purpose of financing a clearly identifiable, quick-disbursing development programme or project (including a sector project) which, whether or not it is included in the Association's own lending programme, shall be appraised, approved and administered in accordance with the procedures and practices applicable to development credits made out of the Association's regular resources, taking account of the objective of additionality referred to in paragraph (b) of the preamble to this Agreement. The resources of the Special Action Account shall not be used in substitution for regular resources of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ("the Bank") or of the Association committed under a loan or credit for a programme or project which, at the effective date of this Agreement, shall have been approved by the executive directors of the Bank or the Association.
Except as provided in Section 4, the terms of repayment of each Special Action Credit shall be the same as those generally applicable to development credits made by the Association, that is to say, it shall be repayable over 50 years and with a 10-year grace period. Special Action Credits shall not bear interest.
Special Action Credits shall be made in one or more currencies of the Member States and shall be repayable in those currencies.
Consistent with the normal procedures of the Association, the administrator is authorized to require each borrower under a Special Action Credit to pay to the Association a service charge at the rate of three fourths of one per cent (3/4 of 1 %) per annum, payable in any currency acceptable to the Association, (1) As those terms are defined from time to time by or pursuant to Resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly. on the principal amount of the Credit withdrawn and outstanding from time to time to compensate it for the services rendered hereunder. Amounts paid for this charge shall be paid directly to and retained by the Association.
Each Special Action Credit shall be evidenced by a separate credit agreement between the borrowing country and the administrator, indicating in particular the origin of the resources.
The proceeds of each Special Action Credit may be used for expenditures in the currency of the borrowing country or for goods produced in, or services supplied from, (i) any of the Member States ; (ii) developing countries which are members of the Association and which could be recipients of a Special Action Credit, as determined by the administrator at the time of the agreement of the credit.
The principal repayments of Special Action Credits shall be made payable to the Special Action Account and the amount of the currency of a Member State so repaid shall as soon as practicable thereafter be returned by the administrator to such Member State. The Association shall not be liable for any shortfall in the repayment of Special Action Credits.
Until all Special Action Credits shall have been committed, the administrator shall keep the EEC informed of projects and programmes being prepared for consideration by the executive directors and those which have been approved by the executive directors. During the period of disbursement of Special Action Credits the administrator shall inform the EEC quarterly of the progress of the Special Action Credits and of the disbursements made thereunder. The administrator shall, as soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year of the Association, furnish to the EEC a detailed statement of the Special Action Account, together with an opinion of the Association's own external auditors of such statement. After the Special Action Credits shall have been fully disbursed, the administrator shall as soon as practicable furnish to the EEC a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed from the Special Action Account.
The administrator shall establish and maintain appropriate records and accounts to identify the contributions to the Special Action Account, the commitments to be financed out of the Account, and the receipts and disbursements of funds in the Account and repayments to the Member States.
The EEC and the administrator shall fully cooperate with each other to achieve the purposes of these arrangements. To that end, until the Special Action Account is fully disbursed, the EEC (acting through the Commission of the European Communities) and the administrator shall, from time to time, exchange views on the status and condition of the Special Action Account, on the progress of the programmes or projects financed out of the Special Action Credits, and on all other matters relating to these arrangements.
If this Agreement shall not have become effective by 31 December 1978, or such later date as may be agreed between the EEC and the Association, this Agreement and all obligations of the parties thereunder shall forthwith terminate.
If and when the entire principal amount of all Special Action Credits withdrawn by borrowers thereunder shall have been repaid and returned to the Member States in accordance with Section 8 of Article II of this Agreement, this Agreement and all obligations of the parties thereunder shall forthwith terminate.
This Agreement shall be approved by each Member State and the EEC in accordance with the procedural requirements of each party.
The Government of each Member State shall notify the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities when such procedural requirements applicable to it have been completed. The General Secretariat shall forward such notification, together with a notification that the EEC has duly approved this Agreement, to the Association.
This Agreement shall become effective and enter into force on the first day of the month following receipt by the Association of such notifications.

AGREEMENT in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Settlements concerning the mobilization of claims held by the Member States under the medium-term financial assistance arrangements
A. Letter from the Bank for International Settlements
The BIS could conclude stand-by credit agreements with the creditor countries' central banks if they should so request.
These agreements could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid into the mechanism by the creditor country, with an overall limit of 2 725 million units of account, corresponding to half of the total of future commitment ceilings of the member countries.
The practical details of each stand-by agreement would be determined by agreement between the BIS and the central bank in question. However, certain conditions, which the BIS would be prepared to apply, can be indicated already:
The initial commitment of the BIS for each stand-by credit would be for two years with the option of renewal for other periods, the total not to exceed five years.
On the opening of credits, and whenever they are renewed, the BIS would take a Commission. It would also be understood that, in order to allow it to carry out the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity, the first drawings would not take place until one month after the conclusion of the stand-by agreement. Drawings would be in the currencies available to the BIS at the time the agreements were concluded, most probably in US dollars ; they would be for periods to be negotiated in the light of the Bank's resources, probably three or six months. The conditions would be equivalent to those applied by the BIS at the time for transactions concluded on similar terms, i.e. at close to market rates. Normally, these rates should be only slightly above Libor. However, if the BIS should itself have to have recourse to the market to procure the necessary funds, the rate applied could reach a maximum equivalent to Libor plus an appropriate margin.
I should be obliged if you would inform me whether the Council of the European Communities is in agreement with the above.
Please accept, Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration.

CONCERNED particularly with those species of wild animals that migrate across or outside national jurisdictional boundaries;
RECOGNIZING that the States are and must be the protectors of the migratory species of wild animals that live within or pass through their national jurisdictional boundaries;
CONVINCED that conservation and effective management of migratory species of wild animals require the concerted action of all States within the national jurisdictional boundaries of which such species spend any part of their life cycle;
RECALLING Recommendation 32 of the Action Plan adopted by the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm, 1972) and noted with satisfaction by the Twenty-seventh Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations,
HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

PROTOCOL TO THE AGREEMENT ON IMPLEMENTATION OF ARTICLE VII OF THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE
The Parties to the Agreement on implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on tariffs and trade (hereinafter referred to as "the Agreement"),
Having regard to the multilateral trade negotiations and to the desire expressed by the Trade Negotiations Committee at its meeting of 11 and 12 April 1979 to arrive at a single text of an Agreement on implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement of tariffs and trade;
Recognizing that developing countries may have particular problems in applying the Agreement;
Hereby: I 1. Agree to the deletion of the provision of Article 1 (2) (b) (iv) of the Agreement;
2. Recognize that the five-year delay in the application of the provisions of the Agreement by developing countries provided for in Article 21 (1) may, in practice, be insufficient for certain developing countries. In such cases a developing country Party to the Agreement may request before the end of the period referred to in Article 21 (1) an extension of such period, it being understood that the Parties to the Agreement will give sympathetic consideration to such a request in cases where the developing country in question can show good cause;
3. Recognize that developing countries which currently value goods on the basis of officially established minimum values may wish to make a reservation to enable them to retain such values on a limited and transitional basis under such terms and conditions as may be agreed to by the Parties to the Agreement;
4. Recognize that developing countries which consider that the reversal of the sequential order at the request of the importer provided for in Article 4 of the Agreement may give rise to real difficulties for them may wish to make a reservation to Article 4 in the following terms:
"The Government of ... reserves the right to provide that the relevant provision of Article 4 of the Agreement shall apply only when the customs authorities agree to the request to reverse the order of Articles 5 and 6."
If developing countries make such a reservation, the Parties to the Agreement shall consent to it under Article 23 of the Agreement;
5. Recognize that developing countries may wish to make a reservation with respect to Article 5 (2) of the Agreement in the following terms:
"The Government of ... reserves the right to provide that Article 5 (2) of the Agreement shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of the relevant note thereto whether or not the importer so requests."
If developing countries make such a reservation, the Parties to the Agreement shall consent to it under Article 23 of the Agreement;
6. Recognize that certain developing countries have expressed concern that there may be problems in the implementation of Article 1 of the Agreement in so far as it relates to importations into their countries by sole agents, sole distributors and sole concessionaires. The Parties to the Agreement agree that, if such problems arise in practice in developing countries applying the Agreement, a study of this question shall be made, at the request of such countries, with a view to finding appropriate solutions;
7. Agree that Article 17 recognizes that in applying the Agreement, customs administrations may need to make enquiries concerning the truth or accuracy of any statement, document or declaration presented to them for customs valuation purposes. They further agree that the Article thus acknowledges that enquiries may be made which are, for example, aimed at verifying that the elements of value declared or presented to customs in connection with a determination of customs value are complete and correct. They recognize that Parties to the Agreement, subject to their national laws and procedures, have the right to expect the full cooperation of importers in these enquiries;
II 1. Upon the entry into force of the Agreement the provisions of this Protocol shall be deemed to be part of the Agreement.
2. This Protocol shall be deposited with the Director-General to the Contracting Parties to the GATT. It is open for acceptance, by signature or otherwise, by signatories of the Agreement on implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on tariffs and trade and by other governments accepting or acceding to the Agreement pursuant to the provisions of Article 22 thereof.
ARRANGEMENT in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Argentine Republic on trade in mutton and lamb
- frozen mutton, lamb and goatmeat (02.01 A IV b)).
2. Within the terms of this arrangement, the possibilities of export of mutton and lamb and goatmeat from Argentina to the Community are fixed at the following annual quantity : 20 000 tonnes expressed in carcass weight (1).
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the arrangement, Argentina undertakes to implement the appropriate procedures to ensure that the annual quantity actually exported does not exceed the quantity agreed and shall be exported in accordance with the traditional patterns of presentation (frozen or chilled).
Should changes in technology and trade make it possible to modify the presentational structure of trade, the two parties to this arrangement will consult each other prior to any such modification in the Committee mentioned in clause 10 in order to find an adequate solution.
3. Should the Community have recourse to the safeguard clause, it undertakes that Argentina's access into the Community as provided for in this arrangement will not be affected.
4. If imports in any one year exceed the quantities agreed, the Community reserves the right to suspend imports from Argentina for the remainder of that year. The quantity overshipped shall be offset against Argentina's export entitlement for the following year.
5. The Community undertakes to limit the levy applicable to imports of products covered by the present arrangement to a maximum amount of 10 %, ad valorem. (1)Carcass weight (bone-in equivalent weight). By this term is understood the weight of bone-in meat presented as such as well as boned meat converted by a coefficient into bone-in weight. For this purpose 55 kg of boned mutton corresponds to 100 kg of bone-in mutton and 60 kg of boned lamb corresponds to 100 kg of bone-in lamb.
6. At the time of accession of new Member States, the Community, in consultation with Argentina, will alter the quantities set out in paragraph 2, in accordance with Argentina's trade with each new Member State.
The charges applicable to imports for the said new Member States shall be fixed in accordance with rules in the Treaty of Accession ; the maximum level of the levy specified in point 5 of this arrangement being taken into account.
The total quantity as mentioned in clause 2 above is fixed at 23 000 tonnes in carcass weight as from the date of accession of Greece to the Community.
7. The Community will endeavour to avoid any market development which could prejudice the marketing of Argentina's mutton and lamb on the Community market within the limits of the quantities agreed. In particular, the Community will take steps to ensure that the disposal of intervention stocks in frozen form arising from the operation of the regulation does not undermine such marketing of Argentina's mutton and lamb.
8. In taking account of the objectives and provisions of this arrangement the Community agrees that any actual implementation of refunds or any other form of assistance with respect to exports of mutton, lamb and live sheep and lamb intended for slaughter will apply only at prices and on conditions which comply with existing international obligations and in respect of the traditional shares of the Community of world export trade in these products. These words shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article XVI of GATT and in particular in conformity with Article 10 (2) (c) of the Agreement on interpretation and application of Articles VI, XVI and XXIII of the General Agreement on tariffs and trade.
9. Argentina shall ensure that this arrangement is observed, in particular, by issuing export certificates covering the products referred to in paragraph 1 within the limits of the quantities covered by this arrangement.
For its part, the Community shall undertake to adopt all necessary provisions to make the issue of the import certificates for the products referred to above, originating in Argentina, subject to the presentation of an export certificate, issued by the competent authority designated by the Argentine Government.
Detailed rules for applying this system shall be laid down in such a way as to render unnecessary the lodging of a security for the issue of the import certificate in respect of the products in question.
Also, such detailed rules of application shall provide that the competent Argentine authority shall communicate periodically to the competent authority of the Community the quantities in respect of which export certificates are issued, broken down, where appropriate, according to destination.
10. A consultative committee shall be set up composed of representatives from the Community and from Argentina. The Committee shall ensure that the arrangement is being properly applied and is functioning smoothly. It will examine regularly the trend of the two parties' markets in mutton and lamb and goatmeat and the trend of the international market, as well as marketing conditions on those markets including those relevant to the objective set out in clause 7 of this arrangement.
It will ensure that the proper application of the arrangement is not affected by the export of mutton and lamb and goatmeat-based products to the Community under customs headings not referred to by the arrangement.
The Committee will discuss all questions which could arise in applying the arrangement and will recommend appropriate solutions to the competent authorities.
11. The provisions of this arrangement shall be agreed without prejudice to the parties' rights and obligations under GATT.
12. The annual quantity fixed in clause 2 refers to the period running from 1 January to 31 December. The quantity applicable as of the implementation of the present arrangement and until 1 January of the following year will be fixed on a pro rata basis in relation to the total annual quantity and will take into account the seasonality of the trade.
13. This arrangement shall apply, on the one hand, to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and under the conditions laid down in that Treaty and, on the other hand, to the territory of the Argentine Republic.
14. The Agreement shall enter into force on 20 October 1980.
It shall remain in force until 31 March 1984, and shall continue in force thereafter subject to each party having the right to denounce it by giving one year's notice in writing. In any case the provisions of this arrangement will be examined by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with a view to making any adjustment which they agree is necessary.
I should be obliged if you would kindly confirm the agreement of your Government to the foregoing.
Please accept, Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration.

AGREEMENT in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on trade in mutton, lamb and goatmeat
I have the honour to refer to negotiations held between our respective delegations for the purpose of drawing up the provisions relating to the import of mutton and lamb and goatmeat into the Community from New Zealand, together with the implementation of the regulation for a common organization of the market in mutton and lamb and goatmeat. Recognizing the vital dependence of the New Zealand economy on the sheep industry and on the export of mutton and lamb to world markets, particularly to the Community, and the importance of ensuring that the normal marketing of its mutton and lamb on these markets should not be prejudiced, I have the honour to propose an Agreement on the following terms:
- frozen mutton and lamb and goatmeat (02.01 A IV b)).
Under this Agreement New Zealand is guaranteed for its mutton and lamb and goatmeat access possibilities to the Community up to the quantity provided by the Agreement. New Zealand is assured that the normal marketing of its mutton and lamb shall not be prejudiced by the operation of the regulation.

Moreover the two parties shall undertake all possible efforts in order to encourage sheepmeat consumption in the Community without affecting the stability of the market.
In taking account of the objectives and provisions of this Agreement the Community agrees that any actual implementation of refunds or any other form of assistance with respect to exports of mutton, lamb and live sheep and lamb intended for slaughter shall apply only at prices and conditions which comply with existing international obligations and in respect of the traditional shares of the Community of world export trade in these products.

The provisions of the Agreement shall be agreed without prejudice to the parties' rights and obligations under GATT.
The annual quantity fixed in clause 2 refers to the period running from 1 January to 31 December. The quantity applicable in the period between the entry into force of this Agreement and 1 January of the following year shall be fixed on a pro rata basis in relation to the total annual quantity.

For the Government of New Zealand
ARRANGEMENT in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Eastern Republic of Uruguay on trade in mutton and lamb
- frozen mutton, lamb and goatmeat (subheading 02.01 A IV b)) of the Common Customs Tariff).
2. Within the terms of this arrangement, the possibilities of export of mutton and lamb and goatmeat from Uruguay to the Community are fixed at the following annual quantity:
5 100 tonnes expressed in carcass weight (1).
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the arrangement, Uruguay undertakes to implement the appropriate procedures to ensure that the annual quantity actually exported does not exceed the quantity agreed and shall be exported in accordance with the traditional patterns of presentation (frozen or chilled).
Should changes in technology and trade make it possible to modify the presentational structure of trade, the two parties to this arrangement will consult each other prior to any such modification in the committee mentioned in clause 10 in order to find an adequate solution.
3. Should the Community have recourse to the safeguard clause, it undertakes that Uruguay's access to the Community as provided for in this arrangement will not be affected.
4. If imports from Uruguay in any one year exceed the quantities agreed, the Community reserves the right to suspend imports from Uruguay for the remainder of that year. The quantity overshipped shall be offset against Uruguay's export entitlement for the following year.
5. The Community undertakes to limit the levy applicable to imports of products covered by the present arrangement to a maximum amount of 10 %, ad valorem. (1)Carcass weight (bone-in equivalent weight). By this term is understood the weight of bone-in meat presented as such as well as boned meat converted by a coefficient into bone-in weight. For this purpose 55 kg of boned mutton corresponds to 100 kg of bone-in mutton and 60 kg of boned lamb corresponds to 100 kg of bone-in lamb.
6. At the time of accession of new Member States, the Community, in consultation with Uruguay, will alter the quantities set out in clause 2, in accordance with Uruguay's trade with each new Member State. The charges applicable to imports for the said new Member State shall be fixed in accordance with the rules in the Treaty of Accession ; the maximum level of the levy specified in clause 5 of this arrangement being taken into account.
The total quantity as mentioned in clause 2 above is fixed at 5 800 tonnes in carcass weight as from the date of accession of Greece to the Community.
7. The Community will endeavour to avoid any market development which could prejudice the marketing of Uruguay's mutton and lamb on the Community market within the limits of the quantities agreed. In particular, the Community will take steps to ensure that the disposal of intervention stocks in frozen form arising from the operation of the regulation does not undermine such marketing of Uruguay's mutton and lamb.
8. In taking account of the objectives and provisions of this arrangement the Community agrees that any actual implementation of refunds of any other form of assistance with respect to exports of mutton, lamb and live sheep and lambs intended for slaughter will apply only at prices and on conditions which comply with existing international obligations and in respect of the traditional shares of the Community of world export trade in these products. These words shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article XVI of the General Agreement on tariffs and trade and in particular in conformity with Article 10 (2) (c) of the Agreement on interpretation and application of Articles VI, XVI and XXIII of the General Agreement on tariffs and trade.
9. Uruguay shall ensure that this arrangement is observed, in particular, by issuing export certificates covering the products referred to in clause 1 within the limits of the quantities covered by this arrangement.
For its part, the Community shall undertake to adopt all necessary provisions to make the issue of the import certificates for the products referred to above, originating in Uruguay, subject to the presentation of an export certificate, issued by the competent authority designated by the Uruguay Government.
Detailed rules for applying this system shall be laid down in such a way as to render unnecessary the lodging of a security for the issue of the import certificate in respect of the products in question.
Also, such detailed rules of application shall provide that the competent Uruguay authority shall communicate periodically to the competent authority of the Community the quantities in respect of which export certificates are issued, broken down, where appropriate, according to destination.
10. A Consultative Committee shall be set up composed of representatives from the Community and from Uruguay. The Committee shall ensure that the arrangement is being properly applied and is functioning smoothly. It will examine regularly the trend of the two parties' markets in mutton and lamb and goatmeat and the trend of the international market, as well as marketing conditions on those markets including those relevant to the objective set out in clause 7 of this arrangement.
It will ensure that the proper application of the arrangement is not affected by the export of mutton and lamb and goatmeat-based products to the Community under customs headings not referred to by the arrangement.
The Committee will discuss all questions which could arise in applying the arrangement and will recommend appropriate solutions to the competent authorities.
11. The provisions of this arrangement shall be agreed without prejudice to the parties' rights and obligations under GATT.
12. The annual quantity fixed in clause 2 refers to the period running from 1 January to 31 December. The quantity applicable as of the implementation of the present arrangement and until 1 January of the following year will be fixed on a pro rata basis in relation to the total annual quantity and will take into account the seasonality of the trade.
13. This arrangement shall apply, on the one hand, to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and under the conditions laid down in that Treaty and, on the other hand, to the territory of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay.
14. The arrangement shall enter into force on 20 October 1980. It shall remain in force until 31 March 1984, and shall continue in force thereafter subject to each party having the right to denounce it by giving one year's notice in writing. In any case the provisions of this arrangement will be examined by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with a view to making any adjustment which they agree is necessary.

PROTOCOL to the 1979 Convention on long-range transboundary air pollution on long-term financing of the cooperative programme for monitoring and evaluation of the long-range transmission of air pollutants in Europe (EMEP)
Recalling that the Convention on long-range transboundary air pollution (hereinafter referred to as 'the Convention') entered into force on 16 March 1983,
Aware of the importance of the cooperative programme for the monitoring and evaluation of the long-range transmission of air pollutants in Europe (hereinafter referred to as EMEP), as provided for in Articles 9 and 10 of the Convention,
Cognizant of the positive results achieved so far in the implementation of EMEP,
Recognizing that the implementation of EMEP has hitherto been made possible by financial means provided by the United Nations environment programme (UNEP) and by voluntary contributions from governments,
Bearing in mind that since the UNEP contribution will continue only until the end of 1984, and that since this contribution together with the voluntary contributions from governments have been inadequate to support fully the EMEP work plan, it will therefore be necessary to provide for long-term funding after 1984,
Considering the appeal of the Economic Commission for Europe to ECE member governments, contained in its decision B (XXXVIII), to make available, on a basis to be agreed at the first meeting of the Executive Body for the Convention (hereinafter referred to as the 'Executive Body'), the financial resources to enable the Executive Body to carry out its activities, in particular as regards the work of EMEP,
N°ting that the Convention does not contain any provisions for financing EMEP and that it is, therefore, necessary to make appropriate arrangements regarding this matter,
Considering the elements to guide the drafting of a formal instrument supplementing the Convention, as listed in recommendations adopted by the Executive Body at its first session (7 to 10 June 1983),
HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

4. The annual costs of the work programme shall be covered by the mandatory contributions. Contributions in cash and in kind, such as those provided by host countries for international centres, shall be specified in the work programme. Voluntary contributions may, subject to the approval by the executive Body, on the recommendation of the Steering Body, be utilized either for reducing the mandatory contributions or for financing specific activities within the scope of EMEP.
5. Mandatory and voluntary contributions in cash shall be deposited in the General Trust Fund.
1. Mandatory contributions shall be made in accordance with the terms of the Annex to the present Protocol.
2. The Executive Body shall consider the need to amend the Annex:

PROTOCOL TO THE EUROPEAN AGREEMENT on the Exchange of Blood-grouping Reagents
A blood-grouping (1) reagent must react with all blood samples tested which contain the antigen homologous to the antibody or other substance mentioned on the label.
When a reagent is used according to the technique recommended by the producer there must be no evidence of any of the following factors or phenomena: (a) haemolytic properties;
(b) antibodies or other substances besides those mentioned on the label;
(c) bacterial products liable to cause false positive or false negative reactions;
(d) pseudo-agglutination through the formation of rouleaux;
Titre is measured by making successive two-fold dilutions of the reagent under study in an appropriate medium. To each dilution is added an equal volume of a suspension of red corpuscles. The titre is the reciprocal of the figure representing the highest serum dilution in which a reaction occurs, the dilution being calculated without the inclusion of the volume of the corpuscular suspension in the total volume.
In the case of anti-A, anti-B and other reagents intended for use on slides, avidity is expressed by means of the time required for agglutination on a slide.
3. International Standards and International Units
International Standards have been established by the World Health Organization for anti-A and anti-B and incomplete anti-D blood-grouping reagents and are in process of being established for blood-grouping reagents of other specificities. An International Standard Preparation contains, by definition, a certain number of International Units per mg or ml and this definition is independent of the titres observed against particular red corpuscle preparations (2). (1)At the time of approving the present version of the Protocol and its Annexes, it was understood by the representatives of the Contracting Parties that when in the English text of the Agreement the expression "blood incompatibilities" was mentioned, "blood grouping incompatibilities" was implied.
(2)The potency of blood-grouping reagents of most specificities is expressed as the agglutination titre observed in a dilution series, against a suspension of red cells. The titre indicates the dilution of reagent in the last mixture of the series which shows agglutination microscopically visible.
The potency of blood-grouping reagents for which International Standard Preparations exist (at present anti-A and anti-B and incomplete anti-D) can be expressed in International Units (see Bull, Wld. Hlth. Org. 1954, 10, 937, 941-1950, 3, 301) on the basis of the titration of the unknown reagent in comparison with the International Standard, or a national sub-standard.
The International Standard Preparations of blood-grouping sera are dispensed in ampoules containing dried human serum. When reconstituted to the volume of 1 ml, the anti-A and anti-B sera contain by definition 256 International Units per ml. They can be obtained free of charge, from the International Laboratory for Biological Standards of WHO, Statens Seruminstitut, Copenhagen.
The following table shows an example of a comparative titration of the International Standard anti-A Serum (S) and an "unknown" anti-A reagent (U) against A1 red corpuscles and A2B red corpuscles. PIC FILE= "T0045086"
4. Stability and expiry date
Each reagent, when kept under the conditions of storage recommended by the manufacturer, should retain the requisite properties for at least one year.
The expiry date of a reagent in the liquid form as given on the label shall be not more than one year from the date of the last satisfactory potency test. The expiry date can be extended for further periods of one year by repetition of potency tests.
The expiry date of reagents in the dried form as given on the label shall be in accordance with evidence obtained from experiments on stability and shall be approved by the national control authorities.
Blood-grouping reagents may be preserved in the liquid or dried state. Dried reagents shall be kept in an atmosphere of an inert gas or in vacuo, in the glass container in which they were dried and which shall be closed so as to exclude moisture. A dried reagent must not lose more than 0,5 % of its weight when tested by further drying over phosphorus pentoxide at a pressure not exceeding 0,02 mm of mercury for 24 hours.
Reagents shall be prepared with aseptic precautions and shall be free from bacterial contamination. In order to prevent bacterial growth the competent national authority may decide that an antiseptic and/or antibiotic shall be added to the reagent (or to any solvent issued with dried reagents), provided that, in the presence of the added substance, the reagent still fulfils the requirements for specificity and potency.
Blood-grouping sera of human origin must contain at least 2,5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of liquid or reconstituted serum.
Reagents whether in the liquid state or after reconstitution should be transparent and should not contain any sediment, gel or visible particles.
Blood-grouping reagents for international exchanges should preferably not be artificially coloured at least until an international agreement is reached on a uniform system. Any added colouring matter must not interfere with the specific reaction.
7. Dispensing and volume
Blood-grouping reagents shall be dispensed in such a way and in such volumes that the reagent in one container is sufficient for the performance of tests with positive and negative control corpuscles in addition to the performance of tests with the unknown corpuscles. The volume in one container shall be such that the contents can if necessary be used for the performance of the appropriate tests for potency described in this Protocol.
8. Records and samples
Written records shall be kept by the producing laboratory of all steps in the production and control of blood-grouping reagents. Adequate samples of all reagents issued shall be retained by the laboratory until it can be reasonably assumed that the batch is no longer in use.
9. Classification of reagents
Reagents used for blood-grouping may contain substances of human, animal, vegetable (or mineral) origin, of which some constitute the active principle and others are adjuvants for enhancing the activity or maintaining the stability of the reagent.
For technical reasons these reagents have been divided into three categories according to the origin of their active principle. This does not mean that reagents of human origin contain exclusively substances of human origin or that animal or vegetable reagents cannot contain substances of human origin.
10. Labels, leaflets and certificates
A label printed in English and French, in black on white paper, shall be affixed to each final container and shall contain the following information: 1. Name and address of producer;
2. Name of the reagent as it appears in the heading of the relevant specification;
3. Name and amount of antiseptic and/or antibiotic, if present, or indication of absence;
4. The volume or, where the reagent is dried, the volume and composition of the fluid needed for reconstitution;
Moreover, this label or the label of the carton enclosing several final containers, or the leaflet accompanying the containers, shall contain the following information: 1. Full name and address of producer;
2. Name of the reagent as it appears in the heading of the relevant specification ;
3. The volume, or, where the reagent is dried, the volume and composition of the fluid needed for reconstitution;
4. Date of last potency test;
5. Expiry date (if any);
7. Adequate description of the method of use recommended by the producer;
8. Conditions of storage of unopened ampoules and precautions to be taken after opening;
9. Exact composition, including antiseptic and/or antibiotic if any;
10. Statement whether the product contains or does not contain material of human origin.
Each consignment shall be accompanied by a certificate as provided in Article 4 of the Agreement and the Annex to the present Protocol. Examples of labels and leaflets are attached to the present Protocol.
A. BLOOD-GROUPING SERA OF HUMAN ORIGIN
(a) SERA OF HUMAN ORIGIN FOR AB0 GROUPING (i) Anti-A blood-grouping serum (human)
Anti-A serum is derived from the blood of selected group B persons, who may or may not have been immunized by group A red corpuscles or group A specific substance. Anti-A serum agglutinates human red corpuscles containing A antigen, i.e. those of blood groups A and AB, including sub-groups A1, A2, A1B and A2B, and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain A antigen, i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B.
An anti-A serum shall be titrated separately against suspensions of A1, A2, and A2B corpuscles, in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or an equivalent reference preparation. The potency of the serum shall in each case be not less than 64 International Units per ml.
When anti-A serum is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of A1, A2 and A2B cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1, agglutination of each suspension should first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same test is performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or with a reference standard of equivalent avidity.
(ii) Anti-B blood-grouping serum (human)
Anti-B serum is derived from the blood of selected group A persons, who may or may not have been immunized by group B red corpuscles or group B specific substance. Anti-B serum agglutinates human red corpuscles containing B antigen, i.e. those of blood groups B and AB, and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain B antigen, i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A.
An anti-B serum shall be titrated against a suspension of group B corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or an equivalent reference preparation. The potency of the serum shall be not less than 64 International Units per ml.
When anti-B serum is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of B cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1, agglutination should first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same test is performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or with reference standard of equivalent avidity.
(iii) Anti-A + Anti-B (group 0) blood-grouping serum (human)
Anti-A + anti-B (group 0) serum is derived from the blood of selected group 0 persons who may or may not have been immunized by group A and group B red corpuscles or group A and group B specific substances. Anti-A + anti-B (group 0) serum agglutinates human red corpuscles containing A or B agglutinogens or both, i.e. those of group A including subgroups A1 and A2, group B and group AB including subgroups A1B and A2B, and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain A or B agglutinogens, i.e. those of group 0. It agglutinates human red corpuscles containing the Ax (Ay or Ao) antigen (which are not, in general, agglutinated by anti-A serum derived from group B donors).
An anti-A + anti-B (group 0) serum shall be titrated separately against suspensions of A1, and A2 corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or an equivalent standard preparation. It shall also be titrated against a suspension of group B corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood grouping serum or an equivalent standard preparation.
The potency of the serum shall in every case be not less than 64 International Units per ml.
Anti-A + anti-B (group 0) blood-grouping serum used undiluted shall also give readily detectable agglutination of group Ax (Ay or Ao) corpuscles.
When anti-A + anti-B (group 0) serum is mixed on a slide with equal volumes of suspensions of A1 and A2 cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1, agglutination shall first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same tests are performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or with a reference standard of equivalent avidity. When anti-A + anti-B (group 0) serum is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of B cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1, agglutination shall first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same test is performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or a reference preparation of equivalent avidity. When anti-A + anti-B (group 0) serum is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of Ax (Ay or Ao) cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1, agglutination shall first appear in not more than five minutes at a temperature between 18 and 25 °C.
(b) SERA OF HUMAN ORIGIN FOR Rh GROUPING
Anti-Rh blood-grouping sera, whatever their specificity, may be of either of two varieties differing in the conditions under which agglutination of homologous corpuscles is obtained. Certain sera commonly known as "complete" agglutinate corpuscles suspended in saline. With others, commonly known as "incomplete", agglutination can only be obtained in the presence of certain colloids such as bovine albumin or by means of other special techniques. The sera should be used under the conditions specified by the laboratory preparing them.
Some "incomplete" sera will also agglutinate homologous red corpuscles suspended in their own serum or plasma on slides.
The following requirements of potency for Rh grouping sera may need to be revised when International Standard Preparations become available. (i) Anti-D (anti-Rho) blood-grouping serum (human)
Anti-D serum is derived from the blood of one or more persons immunized by the D antigen of the Rh system. It reacts with human red corpuscles containing the D antigen, but not with human red corpuscles which do not contain the D antigen.
"Complete" anti-D sera shall have a titre of not less than 32 against CcDee cells in a solution containing 9 grams sodium chloride per litre.
An "incomplete" anti-D serum shall be titrated against CcDee corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of Incomplete Anti-D (anti-Rho) or an equivalent reference preparation. It shall have a potency of not less than 32 International Units. Besides reacting with all red corpuscles containing the D antigen, the serum should, as far as possible, react with corpuscles containing the Du antigen.
Anti-D sera intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson should, when mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a 40 to 50 % suspension of CcDee corpuscles at approximately 40 °C, show visible agglutination within 30 seconds, and agglutination should be complete within 120 seconds.
(ii) Anti-C (anti Rh') blood-grouping serum (human)
Anti-C serum is derived from the blood of one or more persons immunized by the C agglutinogen of the Rh system. It agglutinates suspensions of human red corpuscles containing the C antigen, but not with human red corpuscles which do not contain the C antigen. In this connection the C antigen is regarded as including the Cw antigen.
Most diagnostic anti-C sera contain "complete" anti-C together with "incomplete" anti-D. These sera are therefore specific for the C antigen only when the cells under test are suspended in a solution containing 9 grams sodium chloride per litre.
Anti-C sera ("complete" or "incomplete") should have a titre of not less than 8 against Ccddee corpuscles.
Anti-C sera intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson (and which must not contain any form of anti-D) should, when mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of Ccddee cells with a volume fraction of 0,4 to 0,5, at approximately 40 °C, show visible agglutination within 30 seconds, and agglutination should be complete within 120 seconds.
(iii) Anti-E (anti-rh") blood-grouping serum (human)
Anti-E serum is derived from the blood of one or more persons immunized by the E antigen of the Rh system. It reacts with human red corpuscles containing the E antigen.
Anti-E sera ("complete" or "incomplete") should have a titre of not less than 8 against ccddEe corpuscles.
Anti-E sera intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson (and which must contain any form of anti-D) should, when mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of ccddEe cells with a volume fraction of 0,4 to 0,5, at approximately 40 °C, show visible agglutination within 30 seconds, and agglutination should be complete within 120 seconds.
(iv) Anti-D + C (anti-Rhorh') blood-grouping serum (human)
Anti-D + E (anti-Rhorh") blood-grouping serum (human)
Sera of specificity anti-D + C and of specificity anti-D + E may be obtained directly from the blood of immunized individuals or may be prepared by mixing anti-D with anti-C or anti-E serum. In a given serum both antibodies must be simultaneously active under the conditions of reaction specified by the producer. Each serum must react with all types of red corpuscles which would react with either of the component antibodies, and must fail to react with red corpuscles which contain neither the C nor D antigen in the case of anti-D +C and neither D nor E antigen in the case of anti-D + E. The titres should not be less than those specified for the component antibodies, but in the case of anti-D + C (which is a frequent combination in the serum of immunized persons) it is desirable that the anti-C titre should be not less than 32 and in the case of anti-D + E it is desirable that the anti-E titre should be not less than 8. Where a serum is intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson, the times of agglutination for all reacting types of red corpuscles should be not less than those specified for the component antibodies.
B. REAGENTS OF NON-HUMAN ORIGIN
(a) SERA OF ANIMAL ORIGIN (i) Anti-A blood-grouping serum (animal)
Anti-A serum is derived from the blood of animals which may or may not have been immunized by group A red corpuscles or group A specific substances. Anti-A serum agglutinates human red corpuscles containing A antigen, i.e. those of blood groups A and AB, including sub-groups A1, A2, A1B and A2B, and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain A antigen, i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B.
An anti-A serum shall be titrated separately against suspensions of A1, A2, and A2B red corpuscles, in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or an equivalent reference preparation (1). The potency of the serum shall in each case be not less than 64 International Units per ml.
When anti-A serum is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of A1, A2 and A2B cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1, agglutination of each suspension shall in each case first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same test is performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or with a reference standard of equivalent avidity.
(ii) Anti-B blood-grouping serum (animal)
Anti-B serum is derived from the blood of animals which may or may not have been immunized by group B red corpuscles or group B specific substances. Anti-B serum agglutinates human red corpuscles containing B antigen, i.e. those of blood groups B and AB, and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain B antigen, i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A.
An anti-B serum shall be titrated against a suspension of group B corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or an equivalent reference preparation (1). The potency of the serum shall be not less than 64 International Units per ml.
When anti-B serum is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of B cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1, agglutination shall first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same test is performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or with a reference standard of equivalent avidity.
(iii) Anti-human-globulin serum (animal) (2)
Anti-human globulin serum for use in blood group serology must contain agglutinating antibodies against IgG globulin and agglutinating antibodies against complement factors. It is derived from the blood of animals immunized by the injection of human serum protein. It must agglutinate all human red corpuscles coated with human IgG and/or complement factors. Under the conditions specified by the manufacturers it does not agglutinate uncoated human red corpuscles, to whatever group they may belong.
An anti-human globulin serum, as supplied, or at the dilution recommended on the label, shall strongly agglutinate human red corpuscles coated with a human incomplete anti-D serum, having a titre of 4 (or less) against D-positive corpuscles, when the titration is performed by the albumin replacement method. At the same dilution it shall agglutinate K-positive human red corpuscles sensitized with selected weak anti-K antibodies and Fya positive red corpuscles sensitized with selected weak anti-Fya antibodies.
It shall also, at the same or a different dilution, as specified on the label, agglutinate human red corpuscles sensitized with weak complement-binding incomplete anti-Lea antibodies in the presence of fresh serum.
For clinical use it is desirable that the coating of all the types of incomplete antibodies above shall be detectable with a single dilution of the anti-human globulin serum.
(b) BLOOD-GROUPING REAGENTS OF VEGETABLE ORIGIN (i) Anti-A blood-grouping reagent (vegetable)
Anti-A reagent is prepared by extraction from the seeds or other parts of a suitable plant, followed, if necessary, by purification. Anti-A reagent agglutinates human red corpuscles containing A antigens, i.e. those of blood groups A and AB, including sub-groups A1, A2, A1B and A2B, and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain A antigens, i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B.
An anti-A reagent shall be titrated separately against suspensions of A1, A2 and A2B corpuscles, in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or an equivalent reference preparation (1).
The potency of the reagent shall in each case be not less than 64 International Units per ml.
When anti-A reagent is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of A1, A2 and A2B cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1, agglutination of each suspension shall first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same test is performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or with a reference standard of equivalent avidity.
(ii) Anti-B blood-grouping reagent (vegetable)
Anti-B reagent is prepared by extraction from the appropriate part of a suitable plant, followed, if necessary, by purification. Anti-B reagent agglutinates human red corpuscles containing B antigen, i.e. those of blood groups B and AB, and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain B antigen, i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A.
An anti-B reagent shall be titrated against a suspension of group B corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or an equivalent reference preparation (1). The potency of the reagent shall not be less than 64 International Units per ml.
When anti-B reagent is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of B cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1, agglutination shall first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same test is performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or with a reference standard of equivalent avidity.
(1) The International Standard Preparation is of human origin ; an equivalent reference preparation, if used, may be of human or non-human origin.

CONVENTION on the simplification of formalities in trade in goods
THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY,
AND THE REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA, THE REPUBLIC OF FINLAND, THE REPUBLIC OF ICELAND, THE KINGDOM OF NORWAY, THE KINGDOM OF SWEDEN AND THE SWISS CONFEDERATION
(hereinafter called the EFTA countries)
CONSIDERING the Free Trade Agreements between the Community and each of the EFTA countries;
CONSIDERING the Joint Declaration calling for the creation of a European economic space, adopted by Ministers of the EFTA countries and the Member States of the Community and the Commission of the European Communities in Luxembourg on 9 April 1984, especially with regard to simplification of border formalities and rules of origin;
CONSIDERING that, in the framework of action to strengthen the internal market, the Community has decided to introduce a single administrative document for use in such trade from 1 January 1988;
CONSIDERING it appropriate to simplify also formalities in trade in goods between the Community and the EFTA countries as well as between the EFTA countries themselves, in particular by introducing a single administrative document;
CONSIDERING that no provision of this Convention may be interpreted as exempting the Contracting Parties from their obligations under other international agreements,
HAVE DECIDED TO CONCLUDE THE FOLLOWING CONVENTION:
This Convention lays down measures to simplify formalities in trade in goods between the Community and the EFTA countries, as well as between the EFTA countries themselves, in particular by introducing a single administrative document (hereinafter referred to as the single document) to be used for any procedure at export and import and for a common transit procedure applicable to trade between the Contracting Parties (hereinafter referred to as transit), regardless of the kind and origin of the goods.
Where goods are the subject of trade between the Contracting Parties, the formalities connected with such trade shall be completed using a single document based on a declaration form, the specimens of which are to be found in Annex I to this Convention. The single document shall, depending on the circumstances, serve as a declaration or document of export, transit or import.
Administrative documents may be required by a Contracting Party in addition to the single document only where:
- expressly required for the implementation of a legislation in force in a Contracting Party for which the use of the single document would not suffice;
- required under the terms of international agreements to which it is a party;
1. Nothing in this Convention shall preclude the Contracting Parties from applying simplified procedures, whether or not based on the use of computers, with a view to greater simplification for operators.
2. Simplified procedures may, in particular, consist in allowing operators not to have to present to a customs office either the goods in question or the declaration relating to them, or in allowing them to draw up an incomplete declaration. In such cases, a declaration, which, if the competent authorities agree, may be a general periodic declaration, must be submitted subsequently within the time-limits laid down by those authorities.
In the cases referred to in paragraph 1, operators may be authorized to use commercial documents in the place of the single document.
Where the single document is used, the persons concerned may, on authorization by the competent authorities, attach to it commercial schedules describing the goods in lieu of continuation sheets of the single document for the purpose of completing formalities for any procedure at export and import.
3. Nothing in this Convention shall preclude the Contracting Parties from:
- dispensing with the single document with regard to postal traffic (by letter or parcel post);
- dispensing with the requirement of written declarations;
- concluding between themselves agreements or arrangements with a view to greater simplification of formalities in all or part of the trade between them;
- allowing the use of loading lists for the completion of transit formalities in the case of consignments composed of several kinds of goods, in lieu of continuation sheets of the single document;
- allowing declarations to be made, where appropriate on plain paper, by means of public or private computers on conditions fixed by the competent authorities;
- enabling the competent authorities to require that data necessary for completing the formalities in question be entered in their computerized declaration-processing systems without, where appropriate, requiring a written declaration;
- enabling the competent authorities, should a computerized declaration-processing system be used, to provide that the export, transit or import declaration be constituted either by the single document produced by that system or by entry of the data in the computer if such a document is not produced;
- applying any facility adopted by way of a decision of the Joint Committee, as referred to in Article 11 (3).
1. Provisions on the completion, by means of the single document, of the formalities needed for the export, transit and import of the goods are laid down in Annex II to this Convention.
2. The common codes to be used in the forms laid down in Annex I are to be found in Annex III to this Convention.
1. The declaration must be completed in one of the official languages of the Contracting Parties which is acceptable to the competent authorities of the country in which the export or transit formalities are completed. Where necessary, the customs authority of the country of destination or of transit may require from the declarant or his representative in that country a translation of the said declaration into the official language or one of the official languages of that country.
2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the declaration shall be completed in one of the official languages of the country of import in all cases where the declaration in that country is made on copies of the declaration from other than those presented to the customs authorities of the country of export or departure.
1. The declarant or his representative may, for each stage of an operation involving trade in goods between Contracting Parties, use the copies of the declaration necessary for completion of the formalities relating to that stage alone, to which may be attached, where appropriate, the copies necessary for completion of the formalities relating to one or other of the subsequent stages of that operation.
2. The benefit of the provisions of paragraph 1 shall not be subject to compliance with any special condition imposed by the competent authorities.
However, without prejudice to specific provisions concerning groupage traffic, the competent authorities may lay down that formalities relating to export and transit operations should be completed on the same form by means of copies corresponding to these formalities.
In the cases referred to in Article 7, the competent authorities shall, to the extent possible, satisfy themselves that the particulars given in the copies of the declaration drawn up in the course of the various stages of the operation in question all agree.
2. Assistance may be withheld or denied, totally or partly, when the requested country considers that the assistance would be prejudicial to its security, public policy (ordre public) or other essential interests, or would violate an industrial, commercial or professional secret.
3. If assistance is withheld or denied, the decision and the reasons therefor must be notified to the requesting country without delay.
4. If the customs authority of a country requests assistance which it would not be able to give if requested, it shall draw attention to that fact in the request. Compliance with such a request shall be at the discretion of the customs authority to whom the request is made.
5. Information obtained in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be used solely for the purposes of this Convention and shall be accorded the same protection by a receiving country as is afforded to information of like nature under the national law of that country. Such information may be used for other purposes only with the written consent of the customs authority which furnished them and subject to any restrictions laid down by that authority.
1. A Joint Committee is hereby established in which each Contracting Party to this Convention shall be represented.
2. The Joint Committee shall act by mutual agreement.
3. The Joint Committee shall meet whenever necessary but at least once a year. Any Contracting Party may request that a meeting be held.
4. The Joint Committee shall adopt its own rules of procedure which shall contain, inter alia, provisions for convening meetings and for the designation of the Chairman and his term of office.
5. The Joint Committee may decide to set up any Sub-Committee or Working Party that can assist it in carrying out its duties.
1. It shall be the responsibility of the Joint Committee to administer this Convention and ensure its proper implementation. For this purpose, the said Committee shall be kept regularly informed, by the Contracting Parties, of the experiences gained from application of the Convention, shall make recommendations, and, in the cases provided for in paragraph 3, shall take decisions.
2. In particular, the Joint Committee shall recommend:
(a) amendments to this Convention;
(b) any other measure required for its application.
3. The Joint Committee shall adopt, by decision, amendments to the Annexes to this Convention and facilities referred to in the last indent of Article 4 (3). Such decisions shall put into effect by the Contracting Parties in accordance with their own legislation.
4. If a Contracting Party's representative in the Joint Committee has accepted a decision subject to the fulfilment of constitutional requirements, the decision shall enter into force, if no date is contained therein, on the first day of the second month following notification that the reservation has been lifted.
Each Contracting Party shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the provisions of this Convention are effectively and harmoniously applied taking into account the need to reduce as far as possible the formalities imposed on trade and the need to achieve mutually satisfactory solutions of any difficulties arising out of the operation of those provisions.
The Contracting Parties shall keep each other informed of the provisions which they adopt for the implementation of this Convention.
The Annexes to this Convention shall form an integral part thereof.
1. This Convention shall apply, on the one hand, to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and under the conditions laid down in that Treaty and, on the other hand, to the territories of the EFTA countries.
2. This Convention shall also apply to the Principality of Lichtenstein for as long as that Principality remains bound to the Swiss Confederation by a customs union treaty.
Any Contracting Party may withdraw from this Convention provided it gives twelve months' notice in writing to the depositary referred to in Article 17 which shall notify all other Contracting Parties.
1. This Convention shall enter into force on 1 January 1988, provided that, before 1 November 1987, the Contracting Parties have deposited their instruments of acceptance with the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities, which shall act as depositary.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT ON OLIVE OIL AND TABLE OLIVES, 1986
THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT,
BEARING IN MIND that the olive tree:
- is not only a plant indispensable for the maintenance and conservation of soils, but one which makes it possible to develop land that will not bear other crops and which, even under non-intensive farming conditions, which account for the bulk of present production, responds favourably to any improvement in cultivation,
- is a perennial fruit tree that, with appropriate techniques, permits a return on what is invested in its cultivation,
EMPHASIZING that its cultivation governs the existence and standard of living of millions of families which are wholly dependent on the measures taken to maintain and expand the consumption of its products, both in the producing countries themselves and in non-producing consumer countries,
MINDFUL that olive oil and table olives are essential basic commodities in the regions where olive-growing is established,
BEARING IN MIND that the essential feature of olive production lies in irregular harvests and in the irregularity with which supplies reach the market, and that this results in fluctuations in the value of production, instability of prices and export earnings, and considerable differences in producers incomes,
BEARING IN MIND that these circumstances give rise to special difficulties which may seriously harm the interests of producers and consumers and jeopardize general policies of economic expansion in countries in the regiones where olive-growing is established,
EMPHASIZING in this connection the major importance of olive production to the economies of many countries, particularly developing olive-growing countries,
MINDFUL that the measures to be taken in the light of the very particular characteristics of olive-growing and of the market for its products transcend the national sphere, and that international action is essential,
CONSIDERING the International Olive Oil Agreement, 1956, as amended by the Protocol of 3 April 1958, as well as the International Olive Oil Agreement, 1963, as extended and amended on several occasions, and the International Olive Oil Agreement, 1979,
CONSIDERING that the 1979 Agreement will expire on 31 December 1986,
BEING OF THE VIEW that it is essential to continue and develop the work undertaken within the framework of the said Agreements and that it is desirable to conclude a new Agreement,
HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:
The objectives of the International Agreement on Olive Oil and Table Olives, 1986 (Hereinafter termed 'this
Agreement'), which take account of the provisions of resolutions 93 (IV), 124 (V) and 155 (VI) of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, are as follows:
1. With respect to international cooperation and concerted action:
(c) To foster the coordination of production, industrialization and marketing policies for olive oil, olive-pomace oils and table olives and the organization of the market for these products;
(e) To continue and extend the work done under the previous International Olive Oil Agreements.
2. With respect to the modernization of olive cultivation and olive-oil extraction:
(a) To encourage research and development to elaborate techniques that could:
II(i) modernize olive husbandry and the olive-products industry through technical and scientific planning;
i(ii) improve the quality of the products obtained therefrom;
(iii) reduce the cost of production of the products obtained, particularly that of olive oil, with a view to improving the position of that oil in the overall market for fluid edible vegetable oils;
(iv) improve the situation of the olive-products industry as regards the environment, in accordance with the recommendations of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, to abate any harmful effects;
(b) To encourage the transfer of technology and training in the olive sector.
3. With respect to the expansion of international trade in olive products:
(a) To facilitate the study and application of measures designed to expand international trade in olive products in order to increase the resources that producer countries, and especially developing producer countries, derive from their exports and to enable their economic growth and social development to be hastened, while taking consumer interests into account;
(b) To adopt whatever measures are appropriate to develop the consumption of olive oil and table olives;

CONVENTION ON A COMMON TRANSIT PROCEDURE
THE REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA, THE REPUBLIC OF FINLAND, THE REPUBLIC OF ICELAND, THE KINGDOM OF NORWAY, THE KINGDOM OF SWEDEN, THE SWISS CONFEDERATION,
hereinafter called the EFTA countries,
CONSIDERING the Free Trade Agreements between the Community and each of the EFTA countries,
CONSIDERING the Joint Declaration calling for the creation of a European economic space, adopted by Ministers of the EFTA countries and the Member States of the Community and the Commission of the European Communities in Luxembourg on 9 April 1984, especially with regard to simplification of border formalities and rules of origin,
CONSIDERING the Convention on the simplification of formalities in trade in goods, concluded between the EFTA countries and the Community, introducing a single administrative document for use in such trade,
CONSIDERING that the use of this single document within the framework of a common transit procedure for the carriage of goods between the Community and the EFTA countries and between the EFTA countries themselves would lead to simplification,
CONSIDERING that the most appropriate way of achieving this aim would be to extend to those EFTA countries which do not apply it the transit procedure which currently applies to the carriage of goods within the Community, between the Community and Austria and Switzerland, and between Austria and Switzerland,
CONSIDERING also the Nordic transit order applied between Finland, Norway and Sweden,
HAVE DECIDED to conclude the following Convention:
1. This Convention lays down measures for the carriage of goods in transit between the Community and the EFTA countries as well as between the EFTA countries themselves, including, where applicable, goods transhipped, reconsigned or warehoused, by introducing a common transit procedure regardless of the kind and origin of the goods.
2. Without prejudice to the provisions of this Convention and in particular those concerning guarantees, goods circulating within the Community are deemed to be placed under the Community transit procedure.
3. Subject to the provisions of Articles 7 to 12 below, the rules governing the common transit procedure are set out in Appendices I and II to this Convention.
4. Transit declarations and transit documents for the purposes of the common transit procedure shall conform to and be made out in accordance with Appendix III.
1. The common transit procedure shall hereinafter be described as the T 1 procedure or the T 2 procedure, as the case may be.
2. The T 1 procedure may be applied to any goods carried in accordance with Article 1, paragraph 1.
3. The T 2 procedure shall apply to goods carried in accordance with Article 1, paragraph 1:
(a) in the Community, only when the goods satisfy the conditions laid down in Articles 9 and 10 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community and have not been subject to customs export formalities for the grant of refunds for export to countries, not Member States of the Community, pursuant to the common agricultural policy or when the goods come under the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community and are, under the terms of that Treaty, in free circulation within the Community (Community goods);
(b) in an EFTA country, only when the goods have arrived in that EFTA country under the T 2 procedure and are reconsigned under the special conditions laid down in Article 9 below.
4. The special conditions laid down in this Convention in respect of placing goods under the T 2 procedure shall apply also to the issue of T 2 L documents certifying the Community status of goods and goods covered by a T 2 L document shall be treated in the same way as goods carried under the T 2 procedure, except that the T 2 L document need not accompany the goods.
1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term:
(a) 'transit' shall mean a customs procedure under which goods are carried, under customs control, from a customs office in one country to a customs office in the same or another country over at least one frontier;
(b) 'country', shall mean any EFTA country and any Member State of the Community;
(c) 'third country' shall mean any State which is neither an EFTA country nor a Member State of the Community.
2. In the application of the rules laid down in this Convention for the T 1 or T 2 procedure, the EFTA countries, and the Community and its Member States, shall have the same rights and obligations.
1. This Convention shall be without prejudice to the application of any other international agreement concerning a transit procedure, in particular the TIR procedure or the Rhine manifest, subject to any limitations to such application in respect of the carriage of goods from one point in the Community to another point in the Community and to any limitations to the issue of T 2 L documents certifying the Community status of goods.
2. This Convention shall be without prejudice also to:
Provided that the implementation of any measures applicable to the goods is ensured, countries may, within the T 1 or T 2 procedure, introduce simplified procedures for certain types of traffic by means of bilateral or multilateral agreements. Such agreements shall be notified to the Commission of the European Communities which shall inform the other countries.
Implementation of the transit procedure
1. Subject to any special provisions of this Convention, the competent customs offices of the EFTA countries are empowered to assume the functions of offices of departure, offices of transit, offices of destination and offices of guarantee.
2. The competent customs offices of the Member States of the Community shall be empowered to issue T 1 or T 2 documents for transit to an office of destination situated in an EFTA country. Subject to any special provisions of this Convention, they shall also be empowered to issue T 2 L documents for goods consigned to an EFTA country.
3. Where several consignments of goods are grouped together and loaded on a single means of transport, within the meaning of Article 16, paragraph 2, of Appendix I, and are dispatched as a groupage load by one principal in a single T 1 or T 2 operation, from one office of departure to one office of destination for delivery to one consignee, a Contracting Party may require that those consignments shall, save in exceptional, duly justified cases, be included in one single T 1 or T 2 declaration with the corresponding loading lists.
N° addition, removal or substitution may be made in the case of goods forwarded under cover of a T 1 or T 2 document, in particular when consignments are split up, transhipped or bulked.
1. Goods which are brought into an EFTA country under the T 2 procedure and may be reconsigned under that procedure shall remain at all times under the control of the customs authorities of that country to ensure that there is no change in their identity or state.
2. Where such goods are reconsigned from an EFTA country after having been placed, in that EFTA country, under a customs procedure other than a transit or a warehousing procedure, no T 2 procedure may be applied.
This provision shall, however, not apply to goods which are admitted temporarily to be shown at an exhibition, fair or similar public display and which have received no treatment other than that needed for their preservation in their original state or for splitting up consignments.
3. Where goods are reconsigned from an EFTA country after storage under a warehousing procedure, the T 2 procedure may be applied only on the following conditions:
- that the goods have not been warehoused over a period exceeding five years; however, as regards goods falling within Chapters 1 to 24 of the Nomenclature for the Classification of Goods in Customs Tariffs (International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System of 14 June 1983), that period shall be limited to six months,
- that the goods have been stored in special spaces and have received no treatment other than that needed for their preservation in their original state, or for splitting up consignments without replacing the packaging.
- that any treatment has taken place under customs supervision.
4. Any T 2 ot T 2 L document issued by a customs office of an EFTA country shall bear a reference to the corresponding T 2 or T 2 L document under which the goods arrived in that EFTA country and shall include all special endorsements appearing thereon.
1. Except where otherwise provided for in paragraph 2 below or in the Appendices, any T 1 or T 2 operation shall be covered by a guarantee valid for all countries involved in that operation.
2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not prejudice the right:
(a) of Contracting Parties to agree among themselves that the guarantee shall be waived for T 1 or T 2 operations involving only their territories;
(b) of a Contracting Party not to require a guarantee for the part of a T 1 or T 2 operation between the office of departure and the first office of transit.
3. For the purposes of the flat-rate guarantee as provided for in Appendices I and II to this Convention, the ECU means the total of the following amounts:
0,719 // German mark,
0,0878 // Pound sterling,
1,31 // French franc,

3,71 // Belgian franc,
0,14 // Luxembourg franc,
0,219 // Danish krone,
0,00871 // Irish pound,
1,15 // Greek drachma.
The value of the ECU in a given currency shall be equal to the sum of the exchange values in that currency of the amounts set out above.
1. As a general rule, identification of the goods shall be ensured by sealing.
2. The following shall be sealed:
(a) the space containing the goods, when the means of transport has already been approved under other customs regulations or recognized by the office of departure as suitable for sealing;
(b) each individual package in other cases.

(a) seals can be simply and effectively affixed to them;
(b) they are so constructed that no goods can be removed or introduced without leaving visible traces of tampering or without breaking the seals;
(c) they contain no concealed spaces where goods may be hidden;
(d) the spaces reserved for the load are readily accessible for customs inspection.
4. The office of departure may dispense with sealing if, having regard to other possible measures for identification, the description of the goods in the T 1 or T 2 declaration or in the supplementary documents makes them readily identifiable.
1. Until a procedure has been agreed for the exchange of statistical information to ensure that the EFTA countries and the Member States of the Community have the data necessary for the preparation of their transit statistics, an additional copy of the copy N° 4 of the T 1 and T 2 documents shall be supplied for statistical purposes unless not required by a Contracting Party:
(a) to the first office of transit in each EFTA country;
(b) to the first office of transit in the Community in the case of goods which are the subject of a T 1 or T 2 operation commencing in an EFTA country.

Furthermore, where necessary, they shall communicate to one another all findings relating to goods in respect of which mutual assistance is provided for and which have been subject to a customs warehousing procedure.
3. Where irregularities or infringements are suspected in connection with goods which have been brought into one country from another country or have passed through a country or have been stored under a warehousing procedure, the customs authorities of the countries concerned shall on request communicate to one another all information concerning:
a) the conditions under which those goods were carried:
- whatever the way in which they were reconsigned, where they arrived under cover of a T 1, T 2 or T 2 L document in the country to which the request is addressed, or
- whatever the way in which they arrived, where they were reconsigned under cover of a T 1, T 2 or T 2 L document from the country to which the request is addressed:
b) the conditions of any warehousing of those goods where they arrived in the country to which the request is addressed under cover of a T 2 or T 2 L document or where they were reconsigned from that country under cover of a T 2 or T 2 L document.
4. Any request made under paragraphs 1 to 3 shall specify the case or cases to which it refers.
5. If the customs authority of a country requests assistance which it would not be able to give if requested, it will draw attention to that fact in the request. Compliance with such a request will be within the discretion of the customs authority to whom the request is made.
6. Information obtained in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 3 shall be used solely for the purposes of this Convention and shall be accorded the same protection by a receiving country as is afforded to information of like nature under the national law of that country.

(a) the notifier has received the written consent of the State of import; and
4. Each State of transit which is a Party shall promptly acknowledge to the notifier receipt of the notification. It may subsequently respond to the notifier in writing, within 60 days, consenting to the movement with or without conditions, denying permission for the movement, or requesting additional information. The State of export shall not allow the transboundary movement to commence until it has received the written consent of the State of transit. However, if at any time a Party decides not to require prior written consent, either generally or under specific conditions, for transit transboundary movements of hazardous wastes or other wastes, or modifies its requirements in this respect, it shall forthwith inform the other Parties of its decision pursuant to Article 13. In this latter case, if no response is received by the State of export within 60 days of the receipt of a given notification by the State of transit, the State of export may allow the export to proceed through the State of transit.
5. In the case of a transboundary movement of wastes where the wastes are legally defined as or considered to be hazardous wastes only:
(a) by the State of export, the requirements of paragraph 9 of this Article that apply to the importer or disposer and the State of import shall apply mutatis mutandis to the exporter and State of export, respectively:
(b) by the State of import, or by the States of import and transit which are Parties, the requirements of paragraphs 1, 3, 4 and 6 of this Article that apply to the exporter and State of export shall apply mutatis mutandis to the importer or disposer and State of import, respectively; or
(c) by any State of transit which is a Party, the provisions of paragraph 4 shall apply to such State.
6. The State of export may, subject to the written consent of the States concerned, allow the generator or the exporter to use a general notification where hazardous wastes or other wastes having the same physical and chemical characteristics are shipped regularly to the same disposer via the same customs office of exit of the State of export via the same customs office of entry of the State of import, and, in the case of transit, via the same customs office of entry and exit of the State or States of transit.

FINAL ACT OF THE EUROPEAN ENERGY CHARTER CONFERENCE
I. The final Plenary Session of the European Energy Charter Conference was held at Lisbon on 16 to 17 December 1994. Representatives of the Republic of Albania, the Republic of Armenia, Australia, the Republic of Austria, the Azerbaijani Republic, the Kingdom of Belgium, the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Bulgaria, Canada, the Republic of Croatia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Czech Republic, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Republic of Estonia, the European Communities, the Republic of Finland, the French Republic, the Republic of Georgia, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Hellenic Republic, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Iceland, Ireland, the Italian Republic, Japan, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Latvia, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Republic of Lithuania, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Moldova, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Kingdom of Norway, the Republic of Poland, the Portuguese Republic, Romania, the Russian Federation, the Slovak Republic, the Republic of Slovenia, the Kingdom of Spain, the Kingdom of Sweden, the Swiss Confederation, the Republic of Tajikistan, the Republic of Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of America and the Republic of Uzbekistan (hereinafter referred to as 'the representatives`) participated in the Conference, as did invited observers from certain countries and international organizations.
II. During the meeting of the European Council in Dublin in June 1990, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands suggested that economic recovery in eastern Europe and the then Union of Soviet Socialist Republics could be catalysed and accelerated by cooperation in the energy sector. This suggestion was welcomed by the Council, which invited the Commission of the European Communities to study how best to implement such cooperation. In February 1991 the Commission proposed the concept of a European Energy Charter.
Following discussion of the Commission's proposal in the Council of the European Communities, the European Communities invited the other countries of western and eastern Europe, of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the non-European members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to attend a conference in Brussels in July 1991 to launch negotiations on the European Energy Charter. A number of other countries and international organizations were invited to attend the European Energy Charter Conference as observers.
Negotiations on the European Energy Charter were completed in 1991 and the Charter was adopted by signature of a Concluding Document at a conference held at The Hague on 16 to 17 December 1991. Signatories of the Charter, then or subsequently, include all those listed in Section I, other than observers.
The signatories of the European Energy Charter undertook:
- to pursue the objectives and principles of the Charter and implement and broaden their cooperation as soon as possible by negotiating in good faith a Basic Agreement and Protocols.
The European Energy Charter Conference accordingly began negotiations on a Basic Agreement - later called the Energy Charter Treaty - designed to promote east-west industrial cooperation by providing legal safeguards in areas such as investment, transit and trade. It also began negotiations on Protocols in the fields of energy efficiency, nuclear safety and hydrocarbons, although in the last case negotiations were later suspended until completion of the Energy Charter Treaty.
Negotiations on the Energy Charter Treaty and the Energy Charter Protocol on energy efficiency and related environmental aspects were successfully completed in 1994.
THE ENERGY CHARTER TREATY
III. As a result of its deliberations the European Energy Charter Conference has adopted the text of the Energy Charter Treaty (hereinafter referred to as the 'Treaty`) which is set out in Annex 1 and Decisions with respect thereto which are set out in Annex 2, and agreed that the Treaty would be open for signature at Lisbon from 17 December 1994 to 16 June 1995.
IV. By signing the Final Act, the representatives agreed to adopt the following understandings with respect to the Treaty:
1. With respect to the Treaty as a whole
(a) The representatives underline that the provisions of the Treaty have been agreed upon bearing in mind the specific nature of the Treaty aiming at a legal framework to promote long-term cooperation in a particular sector and as a result cannot be construed to constitute a precedent in the context of other international negotiations.
(b) The provisions of the Treaty do not:
(i) oblige any Contracting Party to introduce mandatory third party access; or
(c) Derogations from most favoured nation treatment are not intended to cover measures which are specific to an investor or group of investors, rather than applying generally.
2. With respect to Article 1 (5)
(a) It is understood that the Treaty confers no rights to engage in economic activities other than economic activities in the energy sector.
(b) The following activities are illustrative of economic activity in the energy sector:
(i) prospecting and exploration for, and extraction of, e.g., oil, gas, coal and uranium;
(ii) construction and operation of power generation facilities, including those powered by wind and other renewable energy sources;
(iii) land transportation, distribution, storage and supply of energy materials and products, e.g., by way of transmission and distribution grids and pipelines or dedicated rail lines, and construction of facilities for such, including the laying of oil, gas, and coal-slurry pipelines;
(iv) removal and disposal of wastes from energy related facilities such as power stations, including radioactive wastes from nuclear power stations;
(v) decommissioning of energy related facilities, including oil rigs, oil refineries and power generating plants;
(vi) marketing and sale of, and trade in energy materials and products, e.g., retail sales of gasoline; and
3. With respect to Article 1 (6)
For greater clarity as to whether an investment made in the area of one Contracting Party is controlled, directly or indirectly, by an investor of any other Contracting Party, control of an investment means control in fact, determined after an examination of the actual circumstances in each situation. In any such examination, all relevant factors should be considered, including the investor's:
(a) financial interest, including equity interest, in the investment;
(b) ability to exercise substantial influence over the management and operation of the investment; and
Where there is doubt as to whether an investor controls, directly or indirectly, an investment, an investor claiming such control has the burden of proof that such control exists.
4. With respect to Article 1 (8)
Consistent with Australia's foreign investment policy, the establishment of a new mining or raw materials processing project in Australia with total investment of $A 10 million or more by a foreign interest, even where that foreign interest is already operating a similar business in Australia, is considered as the making of a new investment.
5. With respect to Article 1 (12)
The representatives recognize the necessity for adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights according to the highest internationally-accepted standards.
6. With respect to Article 5 (1)
The representatives' agreement to Article 5 is not meant to imply any position on whether or to what extent the provisions of the 'Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures` annexed to the Final Act of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations are implicit in Articles III and XI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
7. With respect to Article 6
(a) The unilateral and concerted anti-competitive conduct referred to in Article 6 (2) are to be defined by each Contracting Party in accordance with its laws and may include exploitative abuses.
(b) 'Enforcement` and 'enforces` include action under the competition laws of a Contracting Party by way of investigation, legal proceeding, or administrative action as well as by way of any decision or further law granting or continuing an authorization.
8. With respect to Article 7 (4)
The applicable legislation would include provisions on environmental protection, land use, safety, or technical standards.
9. With respect to Articles 9, 10 and Part V
As a Contracting Party's programmes which provide for public loans, grants, guarantees or insurance for facilitating trade or investment abroad are not connected with investment or related activities of investors from other Contracting Parties in its area, such programmes may be subject to constraints with respect to participation in them.
10. With respect to Article 10 (4)
The supplementary treaty will specify conditions for applying the treatment described in Article 10 (3). Those conditions will include, inter alia, provisions relating to the sale or other divestment of state assets (privatization) and to the dismantling of monopolies (demonopolization).
11. With respect to Articles 10 (4) and 29 (6)
Contracting Parties may consider any connection between the provisions of Article 10 (4) and Article 29 (6).
12. With respect to Article 14 (5)
It is intended that a Contracting Party which enters into an agreement referred to in Article 14 (5) ensure that the conditions of such an agreement are not in contradiction with that Contracting Party's obligations under the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund.
13. With respect to Article 19 (1) (i)
It is for each Contracting Party to decide the extent to which the assessment and monitoring of environmental impacts should be subject to legal requirements, the authorities competent to take decisions in relation to such requirements, and the appropriate procedures to be followed.
14. With respect to Articles 22 and 23
With regard to trade in energy materials and products governed by Article 29, that Article specifies the provisions relevant to the subjects covered by Articles 22 and 23.
15. With respect to Article 24
Exceptions contained in the GATT and Related Instruments apply between particular Contracting Parties which are parties to the GATT, as recognized by Article 4. With respect to trade in energy materials and products governed by Article 29, that Article specifies the provisions relevant to the subjects covered by Article 24.
16. With respect to Article 26 (2) (a)
Article 26 (2) (a) should not be interpreted to require a Contracting Party to enact Part III of the Treaty into its domestic law.
17. With respect to Articles 26 and 27
The reference to treaty obligations in the penultimate sentence of Article 10 (1) does not include decisions taken by international organizations, even if they are legally binding, or treaties which entered into force before 1 January 1970.
18. With respect to Article 29 (2) (a)
(a) Where a provision of GATT 1947 or a Related Instrument referred to in this paragraph provides for joint action by parties to the GATT, it is intended that the Charter Conference take such action.
(b) The notion 'applied on 1 March 1994 and practised with regard to energy materials and products by parties to GATT 1947 among themselves` is not intended to refer to cases where a party to the GATT has invoked Article XXXV of the GATT, thereby disapplying the GATT vis-à-vis another party to the GATT, but nevertheless applies unilaterally on a de facto basis some provisions of the GATT vis-à-vis that other party to the GATT.
19. With respect to Article 33
The provisional Charter Conference should at the earliest possible date decide how best to give effect to the goal of Title III of the European Energy Charter that Protocols be negotiated in areas of cooperation such as those listed in Title III of the Charter.
20. With respect to Article 34
(a) The provisional Secretary-General should make immediate contact with other international bodies in order to discover the terms on which they might be willing to undertake tasks arising from the Treaty and the Charter. The provisional Secretary-General might report back to the provisional Charter Conference at the meeting which Article 45 (4) requires to be convened not later than 180 days after the opening date for signature of the Treaty.
(b) The Charter Conference should adopt the annual budget before the beginning of the financial year.
21. With respect to Article 34 (3) (m)
The technical changes to Annexes might for instance include, delisting of non-signatories or of signatories that have evinced their intention not to ratify, or additions to Annexes N and VC. It is intended that the Secretariat would propose such changes to the Charter Conference when appropriate.
22. With respect to Annex TFU (1)
(a) If some of the parties to an agreement referred to in paragraph 1 have not signed or acceded to the Treaty at the time required for notification, those parties to the agreement which have signed or acceded to the Treaty may notify on their behalf.
(b) The need in general for notification of agreements of a purely commercial nature is not foreseen because such agreements should not raise a question of compliance with Article 29 (2) (a), even when they are entered into by state agencies. The Charter Conference could, however, clarify for purposes of Annex TFU which types of agreements referred to in Article 29 (2) (b) require notification under the Annex and which types do not.
V. The representatives declared that Article 18 (2) shall not be construed to allow the circumvention of the application of the other provisions of the Treaty.
VI. The representatives also noted the following declarations that were made with respect to the Treaty:
1. With respect to Article 1 (6)
The Russian Federation wishes to have reconsidered, in negotiations with regard to the supplementary treaty referred to in Article 10 (4), the question of the importance of national legislation with respect to the issue of control as expressed in the understanding to Article 1 (6).
2. With respect to Articles 5 and 10 (11)
Australia notes that the provisions of Articles 5 and 10 (11) do not diminish its rights and obligations under the GATT, including as elaborated in the Uruguay Round Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures, particularly with respect to the list of exceptions in Article 5 (3), which it considers incomplete.
Australia further notes that it would not be appropriate for dispute settlement bodies established under the Treaty to give interpretations of GATT Articles III and XI in the context of disputes between parties to the GATT or between an investor of a party to the GATT and another party to the GATT. It considers that with respect to the application of Article 10 (11) between an investor and a party to the GATT, the only issue that can be considered under Article 26 is the issue of the awards of arbitration in the event that a GATT panel or the WTO dispute settlement body first establishes that a trade-related investment measure maintained by the Contracting Party is inconsistent with its obligations under the GATT or the Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures.
3. With respect to Article 7
The European Communities and their Member States and Austria, Norway, Sweden and Finland declare that the provisions of Article 7 are subject to the conventional rules of international law on jurisdiction over submarine cables and pipelines or, where there are no such rules, to general international law.
They further declare that Article 7 is not intended to affect the interpretation of existing international law on jurisdiction over submarine cables and pipelines, and cannot be considered as doing so.
4. With respect to Article 10
Canada and the United States of America each affirm that they will apply the provisions of Article 10 in accordance with the following considerations:
For the purposes of assessing the treatment which must be accorded to investors of other Contracting Parties and their investments, the circumstances will need to be considered on a case-by-case basis. A comparison between the treatment accorded to investors of one Contracting Party, or the investments of investors of one Contracting Party, and the investments or investors of another Contracting Party, is only valid if it is made between investors and investments in similar circumstances. In determining whether differential treatment of investors or investments is consistent with Article 10, two basic factors must be taken into account.
The first factor is the policy objectives of Contracting Parties in various fields in so far as they are consistent with the principles of non-discrimination set out in Article 10. Legitimate policy objectives may justify differential treatment of foreign investors or their investments in order to reflect a dissimilarity of relevant circumstances between those investors and investments and their domestic counterparts. For example, the objective of ensuring the integrity of a country's financial system would justify reasonable prudential measures with respect to foreign investors or investments, where such measures would be unnecessary to ensure the attainment of the same objectives in so far as domestic investors or investments are concerned. Those foreign investors or their investments would thus not be 'in similar circumstances` to domestic investors or their investments. Thus, even if such a measure accorded differential treatment, it would not be contrary to Article 10.
The second factor is the extent to which the measure is motivated by the fact that the relevant investor or investment is subject to foreign ownership or under foreign control. A measure aimed specifically at investors because they are foreign, without sufficient countervailing policy reasons consistent with the preceding paragraph, would be contrary to the principles of Article 10. The foreign investor or investment would be 'in similar circumstances` to domestic investors and their investments, and the measure would be contrary to Article 10.
5. With respect to Article 25
The European Communities and their Member States recall that, in accordance with Article 58 of the Treaty establishing the European Community:
(a) companies or firms formed in accordance with the law of a Member State and having their registered office, central administration or principal place of business within the Community shall, for the right of establishment pursuant to Part Three, Title III, Chapter 2 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, be treated in the same way as natural persons who are nationals of Member States; companies or firms which only have their registered office within the Community must, for this purpose, have an effective and continuous link with the economy of one of the Member States;
(b) 'companies and firms` means companies or firms constituted under civil or commercial law, including cooperative societies, and other legal persons governed by public or private law, save for those which are non-profitmaking.

AGREEMENT to promote compliance with international conservation and management measures by fishing vessels on the high seas
THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT,
RECOGNIZING that all States have the right for their nationals to engage in fishing on the high seas, subject to the relevant rules of international law, as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,
FURTHER RECOGNIZING that, under international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, all States have the duty to take, or to cooperate with other States in taking, such measures for their respective nationals as may be necessary for the conservation of the living resources of the high seas,
ACKNOWLEDGING the right and interest of all States to develop their fishing sectors in accordance with their national policies, and the need to promote cooperation with developing countries to enhance their capabilities to fulfil their obligations under this Agreement,
RECALLING that Agenda 21, adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, calls upon States to take effective action, consistent with international law, to deter reflagging of vessels by their nationals as a means of avoiding compliance with applicable conservation and management rules for fishing activities on the high seas,
FURTHER RECALLING that the Declaration of Cancún, adopted by the International Conference on Responsible Fishing, also calls on States to take action in this respect,
BEARING IN MIND that under Agenda 21, States commit themselves to the conservation and sustainable use of marine living resources on the high seas,
CALLING UPON States which do not participate in global, regional or subregional fisheries organizations or arrangements to join or, as appropriate, to enter into understandings with such organizations or with parties to such organizations or arrangements with a view to achieving compliance with international conservation and management measures,
CONSCIOUS OF the duties of every State to exercise effectively its jurisdiction and control over vessels flying its flag, including fishing vessels and vessels engaged in the transhipment of fish,
MINDFUL that the practice of flagging or reflagging fishing vessels as a means of avoiding compliance with international conservation and management measures for living marine resources, and the failure of flag States to fulfil their responsibilities with respect to fishing vessels entitled to fly their flag, are among the factors that seriously undermine the effectiveness of such measures,
REALIZING that the objective of this Agreement can be achieved through specifying flag States' responsibility in respect of fishing vessels entitled to fly their flags and operating on the high seas, including the authorization by the flag State of such operations, as well as through strengthened international cooperation and increased transparency through the exchange of information of high seas fishing,
NOTING that this Agreement will form an integral part of the International Code of Conduct for Responsible Fishing called for in the Declaration of Cancún,
DESIRING to conclude an international agreement within the framework of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, hereinafter referred to as FAO, under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution,
HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:
For the purposes of this Agreement:
(a) 'fishing vessel` means any vessel used or intended for use for the purposes of the commercial exploitation of living marine resources, including mother ships and any other vessels directly engaged in such fishing operations;
(b) 'international conservation and management measures` means measures to conserve or manage one or more species of living marine resources that are adopted and applied in accordance with the relevant rules of international law as reflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Such measures may be adopted either by global, regional or subregional fisheries organizations, subject to the rights and obligations of their members, or by treaties or other international agreements;
(i) for any fishing vessel built after 18 July 1982, 96 % of the total length on a waterline at 85 % of the least moulded depth measured from the top of the keel, or the length from the foreside of the stem to the axis of the rudder stock on that waterline, if that be greater. In ships designed with a rake of keel the waterline on which this length is measures shall be parallel to the designed waterline;
(ii) for any fishing vessel built before 18 July 1982, registered length as entered on the national register or other record of vessels;
(d) 'record of fishing vessels` means a record of fishing vessels in which are recorded pertinent details of the fishing vessel. It may constitute a separate record for fishing vessels or form part of a general record of vessels;
(e) 'regional economic integration organization` means a regional economic integration organization to which its member States have transferred competence over matters covered by this Agreement, including the authority to make decisions binding on its member States in respect of those matters;
(f) 'vessels entitled to fly its flag` and 'vessels entitled to fly the flag of a State`, includes vessels entitled to fly the flag of a member State of a regional economic integration organization.
(b) shall not apply to the obligations undertaken by a party under paragraph 1 of Article III, or paragraph 7 of Article VI of this Agreement.
3. Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 2 above, in any fishing region where bordering coastal States have not yet declared exclusive economic zones, or equivalent zones of national jurisdiction over fisheries, such coastal States as are parties to this Agreement may agree, either directly or through appropriate regional fisheries organizations, to establish a minimum length of fishing vessels below which this Agreement shall not apply in respect of fishing vessels flying the flag of any such coastal State and operating exclusively in such fishing region.
1. (a) Each party shall take such measures as may be necessary to ensure that fishing vessels entitled to fly its flag do not engage in any activity that undermines the effectiveness of international conservation and management measures.
(b) In the event that a party has, pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article II, granted an exemption for fishing vessels of less than 24 metres in length entitled to fly its flag from the application of other provisions of this Agreement, such party shall nevertheless take effective measures in respect of any such fishing vessel that undermines the effectiveness of international conservation and management measures. These measures shall be such as to ensure that the fishing vessel ceases to engage in activities that undermine the effectiveness of the international conservation and management measures.
2. In particular, no party shall allow any fishing vessel entitled to fly its flag to be used for fishing on the high seas unless it has been authorized to be so used by the appropriate authority or authorities of that party. A fishing vessel so authorized shall fish in accordance with the conditions of the authorization.
3. No party shall authorize any fishing vessel entitled to fly its flag to be used for fishing on the high seas unless the Party is satisfied that it is able, taking into account the links that exist between it and the fishing vessel concerned, to exercise effectively its responsibilities under this Agreement in respect of that fishing vessel.
4. Where a fishing vessel that has been authorized to be used for fishing on the high seas by a party ceases to be entitled to fly the flag of that party, the authorization to fish on the high seas shall be deemed to have been cancelled.
5. (a) No party shall authorize any fishing vessel previously registered in the territory of another party that has undermined the effectiveness of international conservation and management measures to be used for fishing on the high seas, unless it is satisfied that:
(i) any period of suspension by another party of an authorization for such fishing vessel to be used for fishing on the high seas has expired; and
(ii) no authorization for such fishing vessel to be used for fishing on the high seas has been withdrawn by another party within the last three years.
(b) The provisions of subparagraph (a) above shall also apply in respect of fishing vessels previously registered in the territory of a State which is not a party to this Agreement, provided that sufficient information is available to the party concerned on the circumstances in which the authorization to fish was suspended or withdrawn.
(c) The provisions of subparagraphs (a) and (b) shall not apply where the ownership of the fishing vessel has subsequently changed, and the new owner has provided sufficient evidence demonstrating that the previous owner or operator has no further legal, beneficial or financial interest in, or control of, the fishing vessel.
(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraphs (a) and (b) above, a party may authorize a fishing vessel, to which those subparagraphs would otherwise apply, to be used for fishing on the high seas, where the party concerned, after having taken into account all relevant facts, including the circumstances in which the fishing authorization has been withdrawn by the other party or State, has determined that to grant an authorization to use the vessel for fishing on the high seas would not undermine the object and purpose of this Agreement.
6. Each party shall ensure that all fishing vessels entitled to fly its flag that it has entered in the record maintained under Article IV are marked in such a way that they can be readily identified in accordance with generally accepted standards, such as the FAO Standard Specifications for the Marking and Identification of Fishing Vessels.
7. Each party shall ensure that each fishing vessel entitled to fly its flag shall provide it with such information on its operations as may be necessary to enable the party to fulfil its obligations under this Agreement, including in particular information pertaining to the area of its fishing operations and its catches and landings.
8. Each party shall take enforcement measures in respect of fishing vessels entitled to fly its flag which act in contravention of the provisions of this Agreement, including, where appropriate, making the contravention of such provisions an offence under national legislation. Sanctions applicable in respect of such contraventions shall be of sufficient gravity as to be effective in securing compliance with the requirements of this Agreement and to deprive offenders of the benefits accruing from their illegal activities. Such sanctions shall, for serious offences, include refusal, suspension or withdrawal of the authorization to fish on the high seas.
Records of fishing vessels
Each party shall, for the purposes of this Agreement, maintain a record of fishing vessels entitled to fly its flag and authorized to be used for fishing on the high seas, and shall take such measures as may be necessary to ensure that all such fishing vessels are entered in that record.
1. The parties shall cooperate as appropriate in the implementation of this Agreement, and shall, in particular, exchange information, including evidentiary material, relating to activities of fishing vessels in order to assist the flag State in identifying those fishing vessels flying its flag reported to have engaged in activities undermining international conservation and management measures, so as to fufil its obligations under Article III.
2. When a fishing vessel is voluntarily in the port of a party other than its flag State, that party, where it has reasonable grounds for believing that the fishing vessel has been used for an activity that undermines the effectiveness of international conservation and management measures, shall promptly notify the flag State accordingly. Parties may make arrangements regarding the undertaking by port States of such investigatory measures as may be considered necessary to establish whether the fishing vessel has indeed been used contrary to the provisions of this Agreement.
3. The parties shall, when and as appropriate, enter into cooperative agreements or arrangements of mutual assistance on a global, regional, subregional or bilateral basis so as to promote the achievement of the objectives of this Agreement.

(b) any deletions from the record by reason of:
(i) the voluntary relinquishment or non-renewal of the fishing authorization by the fishing vessel owner or operator;
(ii) the withdrawal of the fishing authorization issued in respect of the fishing vessel under paragraph 8 of Article III;
(iii) the fact that the fishing vessel concerned is no longer entitled to fly its flag;
(iv) the scrapping, decommissioning or loss of the fishing vessel concerned; or
(v) any other reason.
6. Where information is given to FAO under paragraph 5 (b) above, the party concerned shall specify which of the reasons listed in that paragraph is applicable.

(a) any exemption it has granted under paragraph 2 of Article II, the number and type of fishing vessel involved and the geographical areas in which such fishing vessels operate; and
(b) any agreement reached under paragraph 3 of Article II.
8. (a) Each party shall report promptly to FAO all relevant information regarding any activities of fishing vessels flying its flag that undermine the effectiveness of international conservation and management measures, including the identity of the fishing vessel or vessels involved and measures imposed by the party in respect of such activities. Reports on measures imposed by a party may be subject to such limitations as may be required by national legislation with respect to confidentiality, including, in particular, confidentiality regarding measures that are not yet final.
(b) Each party, where it has reasonable grounds to believe that a fishing vessel not entitled to fly its flag has engaged in any activity that undermines the effectiveness of international conservation and management measures, shall draw this to the attention of the flag State concerned and may, as appropriate, draw it to the attention of FAO. It shall provide that flag State with full supporting evidence and may provide FAO with a summary of such evidence. FAO shall not circulate such information until such time as the flag State has had an opportunity to comment on the allegation and evidence submitted, or to object as the case may be.
9. Each party shall inform FAO of any cases where the party, pursuant to paragraph 5 (d) of Article III, has granted an authorization notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5 (a) or 5 (b) of Article III. The information shall include pertinent data permitting the identification of the fishing vessel and the owner or operator and as appropriate, any other information relevant to the party's decision.
10. FAO shall circulate promptly the information provided under paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of this Article to all parties, and, on request, individually to any party. FAO shall also, subject to any restrictions imposed by the party concerned regarding the distribution of information, provide such information promptly on request individually to any global, regional or subregional fisheries organization.
11. The parties shall exchange information relating to the implementation of this Agreement, including through FAO and other appropriate global, regional and subregional fisheries organizations.
Cooperation with developing countries

AGREEMENT between the European Community, of the one part, and the Government of Denmark and the Home Government of the Faroe Islands, of the other part
THE GOVERNMENT OF DENMARK AND THE HOME GOVERNMENT OF THE FAROE ISLANDS,
RECALLING the status of the Faeroes as a self-governing integral part of one of the Member States of the Community;
RECALLING the resolution of the Council of 4 February 1974 on the problems of the Faeroes;
CONSIDERING the vital importance for the Faeroes of fisheries, which constitute their essential economic activity, fish and fishery products being their main export articles;
CONSIDERING the importance of the fisheries relationship laid down in the Agreement on fisheries between the Contracting Parties, who confirm that the trade aspects of this Agreement should not affect the functioning of the Fisheries Agreement and that, consequently, the volume of the mutual fisheries possibilities under that Agreement should continue to be maintained at a satisfactory level;
DESIRING to consolidate and to extend the economic relations existing between the Community and the Faeroes and to ensure, with due regard for fair conditions of competition, the harmonious development of their commerce for the purpose of contributing to the work of constructing Europe;
RESOLVED progressively to eliminate the obstacles to substantially all their trade, in accordance with the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 concerning the establishment of free trade areas;
DECLARING their readiness to examine, in the light of any relevant factor, and in particular of developments in the Community, the possibility of developing and deepening their relations where it would appear to be useful in the interests of their economies to extend them to fields not covered by this Agreement;
CONSIDERING that, to this end, an Agreement between the European Economic Community, of the one part, and the Government of Denmark and the Home Government of the Faroe Islands, of the other part (hereafter referred to as the 'initial Agreement`) was signed on 2 December 1991;
CONSIDERING that an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community, of the one part, and the Government of Denmark and the Home Government of the Faroe Islands, of the other part, amending Tables I and II of the Annex to Protocol 1 of the initial Agreement (hereafter referred to as the 'Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters`) was signed on 8 March 1995;
CONSIDERING that, pursuant to the accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to the European Union on 1 January 1995, the arrangements applicable to trade in fish and fishery products between the Faeroes and the Community should be adjusted in order to maintain trade flows between the Faeroes, on the one hand, and the new Member States, on the other;
CONSIDERING that, as a result of the adoption by the Community of a common definition of origin for petroleum products, it is necessary to make adjustments to the provisions affecting these products;
CONSIDERING that, in order to take account of certain developments in trade between the Community and the Member States of EFTA, it is necessary to make adjustments to the provisions concerning the definition of the concept of 'originating products` and methods of administrative cooperation;
CONSIDERING that, in order to take account of the specific production of fish feed on the Faeroes, it is necessary to make adjustments to the provisions applicable to imports of certain agricultural products;
CONSIDERING that, in order to help ensure its correct functioning, a Protocol on mutual administrative assistance in customs matters should be incorporated into this Agreement;
CONSIDERING that, in order to conform with certain modifications to the nomenclature of the customs tariffs of the Contracting Parties affecting products referred to in the initial Agreement, it is necessary to update the tariff nomenclature of these products;
CONSIDERING that, in order to provide for more flexibility, it is appropriate to empower the Joint Committee to decide on amendments to the provisions of the Protocols to this Agreement;
CONSIDERING that, for the sake of clarity, the initial Agreement and the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters should be replaced by a composite new text in the form of this Agreement;
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT that the bilateral trade Agreements between Finland and Sweden and the Faeroes cease to be in force on the entry into force of this Agreement;
HAVE DECIDED, in pursuit of these objectives and considering that no provisions of this Agreement may be interpreted as exempting the Contracting Parties from the obligations which are incumbent on them under other international agreements,
TO CONCLUDE THIS AGREEMENT:
The aim of this Agreement is:

Protocol 2 lays down the tariff treatment and arrangements applicable to certain products obtained by processing agricultural products.
1. In the event of specific rules being established as a result of the implementation of its agricultural policy or of any alteration of the current rules, the Contracting Party in question may adapt the arrangements resulting from this Agreement in respect of the products which are the subject of those rules or alterations.
2. In such cases the Contracting Party in question shall take due account of the interests of the other Contracting Party. To this end the Contracting Parties may consult each other within the Joint Committee established by Article 31.
Protocol 3 lays down the definition of the concept of 'originating products` and methods of administrative cooperation.
A Contracting Party which is considering the reduction of the effective level of its duties or charges having equivalent effect applicable to third countries benefiting from most-favoured-nation treatment, or which is considering the suspension of their application, shall, as far as may be practicable, notify the Joint Committee not less than 30 days before such reduction or suspension comes into effect. It shall take note of any representations by the other Contracting Party regarding any distortions which might result therefrom.
1. No new quantitative restriction on imports or measures having equivalent effect shall be introduced in trade between the Community and the Faeroes.

3. The Contracting Parties shall examine, under the conditions set out in Article 35, any difficulties that might arise in their trade in agricultural products and shall endeavour to seek appropriate solutions.
The Home Government of the Faroe Islands shall take the necessary control measures to ensure the correct application of the reference price fixed or to be fixed by the Community, referred to in Article 2 of Protocol 1.
The Contracting Parties shall ensure the correct application of the definition of the concept of 'originating products` and methods of administrative cooperation, laid down in Protocol 3.
Protocol 4 lays down the special provisions applicable to imports of certain agricultural products other than those listed in Protocol 1.
Protocol 5 lays down the provisions on mutual assistance between administrative authorities in customs matters.
The Contracting Parties reaffirm their commitment to grant each other the most-favoured-nation treatment in accordance with the GATT 1994.
This Agreement shall not preclude the maintenance or establishment of customs unions, free trade areas or arrangements for frontier trade, except in so far as they alter the trade arrangements provided for in this Agreement, in particular the provisions concerning rules of origin.
The Contracting Parties shall refrain from any measure or practice of an internal fiscal nature which, whether directly of indirectly, discriminates between the products of one Contracting Party and like products originating in the territory of the other Contracting Party.
Products exported to the territory of one of the Contracting Parties may not benefit from repayment of internal taxation in excess of the amount of direct or indirect taxation imposed on them.
Payments relating to trade in goods and the transfer of such payments to the Member State of the Community in which the creditor is resident or to the Faeroes shall be free from any restrictions.
This Agreement shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, law and order or public security, the protection of life and health of humans, animals or plants, the protection of national treasures of artistic, historic or archaeological value, the protection of industrial and commercial property, or rules relating to gold or silver.
Such prohibitions or restrictions must not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between the Contracting Parties.
Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a Contracting Party from taking any measures:
(a) which it considers necessary to prevent the disclosure of information contrary to its essential security interests;
(b) which relate to trade in arms, munitions or war materials or to research, development or production indispensable for defence purposes, provided that such measures do not impair the conditions of competition in respect of products not intended for specifically military purposes;
(c) which it considers essential to its own security in time of war or serious international tension.
1. The Contracting Parties shall refrain from any measure likely to jeopardize the fulfilment of the objectives of this Agreement.
2. They shall take any general or specific measures required to fulfil their obligations under this Agreement.
If either Contracting Party considers that the other Contracting Party has failed to fulfil an obligation under this Agreement, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 29.
1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement in so far as they may affect trade between the Community and the Faeroes:
(i) all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition as regards the production of or trade in goods;
(ii) abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the Contracting Parties as a whole or in a substantial part thereof;
(iii) any public aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods.
2. Should a Contracting Party consider that a given practice is incompatible with this Article, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 29.
Where an increase in imports of a given product is or is likely to be seriously detrimental to any production activity carried on in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties and where this increase is due to:
(i) the partial or total reduction in the importing Contracting Party, as provided for in this Agreement, of customs duties and charges having equivalent effect levied on the product in question; and
(ii) the fact that the duties or charges having equivalent effect levied by the exporting Contracting Party on imports of raw materials or intermediate products used in the manufacture of the product in question are significantly lower than the corresponding duties or charges levied by the importing Contracting Party:
the Contracting Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 29.
If one of the Contracting Parties finds that dumping is taking place in trade with the other Contracting Party, it may take appropriate measures against this practice in accordance with the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the GATT 1994, under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 29.
If serious disturbances arise in any sector of the economy or if difficulties arise which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a region, the Contracting Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 29.
1. In the event of a Contracting Party subjecting imports of products liable to give rise to the difficulties referred to in Articles 26 and 28 to an administrative procedure, the purpose of which is to provide rapid information on the trend of trade flows, it shall inform the other Contracting Party.
2. In the cases specified in Articles 24 to 28, before taking the measures provided for therein or, in cases to which paragraph 3 (d) of this Article applies, as soon as possible, the Contracting Party in question shall supply the Joint Committee with all relevant information required for a thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Contracting Parties.
In the selection of measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of this Agreement.
The safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Joint Committee and shall be the subject of periodical consultations within the Committee, particularly with a view to their abolition as soon as circumstances permit.
3. For the implementation of paragraph 2, the following provisions shall apply:
(a) as regards Article 25, either Contracting Party may refer the matter to the Joint Committee if it considers that a given practice is incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement within the meaning of Article 25 (1).
The Contracting Parties shall provide the Joint Committee with all relevant information and shall give it the assistance it requires in order to examine the case and, where appropriate, to eliminate the practice objected to.
If the Contracting Party in question fails to put an end to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee, or in the absence of agreement in the Joint Committee within three months of the matter being referred to it, the Contracting Party concerned may adopt any safeguard measures it considers necessary to deal with the serious difficulties resulting from the practices in question; in particular it may withdraw tariff concessions;
(b) as regards Article 26, the difficulties arising from the situation referred to in that Article shall be referred for examination to the Joint Committee, which may take any decision needed to put an end to such difficulties.
If the Joint Committee or the exporting Contracting Party has not taken a decision putting an end to the difficulties within 30 days of the matter being referred, the importing Contracting Party is authorized to levy a compensatory charge on the product imported.
The compensatory charge shall be calculated according to the incidence on the value of the goods in question of the tariff disparities in respect of the raw materials or intermediate products incorporated therein;
(c) as regards Article 27, consultation in the Joint Committee shall take place before the Contracting Party concerned takes the appropriate measures;
(d) where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior examination impossible, the Contracting Party concerned may, in the situations specified in Articles 26, 27 and 28 and also in the case of export aids having a direct and immediate incidence on trade, apply forthwith the precautionary measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation.
Where one or more Member States of the Community or the Faeroes is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments, the Contracting Party concerned may take the necessary safeguard measures. It shall inform the other Contracting Party forthwith.
1. A Joint Committee is hereby established which shall be responsible for the administration of this Agreement and shall ensure its proper implementation. For this purpose, it shall make recommendations and take decisions in the cases provided for in this Agreement.

AGREEMENT between the European Community and New Zealand on sanitary measures applicable to trade in live animals and animal products
hereinafter referred to as 'the Parties`;
WHEREAS the Parties acknowledge that their systems of sanitary measures are intended to provide comparable health assurances;
REAFFIRMING their commitment to the rights and obligations established pursuant to the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (hereinafter referred to as 'the SPS Agreement`);
DESIRING to facilitate trade in live animals and animal products between the European Community (hereinafter referred to as 'the Community`) and New Zealand while safeguarding public and animal health and thereby meeting consumer expectations in relation to the wholesomeness of food products;
DESIRING to resolve other veterinary issues applicable to trade in live animals and animal products between the Community and New Zealand;
RESOLVED to take the fullest account of the risk of spread of animal infection and disease and the measures put in place to control and eradicate such infections and diseases, and in particular to avoid disruptions to trade,
HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:
The objective of this Agreement is to facilitate trade in live animals and animal products between the Community and New Zealand by establishing a mechanism for the recognition of equivalence of sanitary measures maintained by the two Parties consistent with the protection of public and animal health, and to improve communication and cooperation on sanitary measures.
The provisions set out in this Agreement shall apply in respect of trade between the Community and New Zealand in live animals and animal products.
The jointly determined arrangements for the application of this Agreement by the Parties are set out in the Annexes.
Nothing in this Agreement or the Annexes shall limit the rights or obligations of the Parties pursuant to the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization and its Annexes, and in particular the SPS Agreement.
1. The scope of this Agreement shall be limited initially to the sanitary measures applied by either Party to the live animals and animal products listed in Annex I, except as provided for in paragraphs 2 and 3.
2. Unless otherwise specified under the provisions set out in the Annexes to this Agreement and without prejudice to Article 11, this Agreement shall not apply to sanitary measures related to food additives (all food additives and colours), sanitary stamps, processing aids, flavours, irradiation (ionization), contaminants (including microbiological standards), transport, chemicals originating from the migration of substances from packaging materials, labelling of foodstuffs, nutritional labelling, medicated feeds and premixes.
3. The Parties may also agree to apply the principles of this Agreement to address veterinary issues other than sanitary measures applicable to trade in live animals and animal products.
4. The Parties may agree to modify this Agreement in the future, to extend the scope to other sanitary or phytosanitary measures affecting trade between the Parties.
For the purposes of this Agreement the following definitions shall apply:
(a) live animals and animal products: means the live animals and animal products covered by the provisions listed in Annex I;
(b) sanitary measures: means sanitary measures as defined in Annex A, paragraph 1, of the SPS Agreement falling within the scope of this Agreement;
(c) appropriate level of sanitary protection: means the level of protection as defined in Annex A, paragraph 5, of the SPS Agreement;
(d) region: means 'zones` and 'regions` as defined in the Animal Health Code of the Office international des épizooties;
(i) New Zealand - the authorities described in Part A of Annex II;
(ii) European Community - the authorities described in Part B of Annex II.
Adaptation to regional conditions
1. The Parties recognize for trade between them regional freedom from the animal diseases specified in Annex III.
2. Where one of the Parties considers that it has a special status with respect to a specific disease, it may request recognition of this status. The Party concerned may also request additional guarantees in respect of imports of live animals and animal products appropriate to the agreed status. The guarantees for specific diseases shall be specified in Annex V.
3. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the importing Party shall recognize regionalization decisions taken in accordance with criteria as defined in Annex IV as the basis for trade from a Party within which an area is affected by one or more of the diseases listed in Annex III.
1. The recognition of equivalence requires an assessment and acceptance of:
- the legislation, standards and procedures, as well as the programmes in place to allow control and to ensure domestic and importing countries' requirements are met,
- the documented structure of the relevant responsible authority(ies), their powers, their chain of command, their modus operandi and the resources available to them,
- the performance of the relevant responsible authority in relation to the control programme and assurances.
In this assessment, the Parties shall take account of experience already acquired.
2. Equivalence shall be applied in relation to sanitary measures for live animal or animal product sectors, or parts of sectors, in relation to legislation, inspection and control systems, parts of systems, or in relation to specific legislation, inspection and/or hygiene requirements.
1. In reaching a determination of whether a sanitary measure applied by an exporting Party achieves the importing Party's appropriate level of sanitary protection, the Parties shall follow a process that includes the following steps:
(i) the identification of the sanitary measure(s) for which recognition of equivalence is sought;
(ii) the explanation by the importing Party of the objective of its sanitary measure(s), including an assessment, as appropriate to the circumstances, of the risk, or risks, that the sanitary measure(s) is intended to address, and identification by the importing Party of its appropriate level of sanitary protection;
(iii) the demonstration by the exporting Party that its sanitary measure(s) achieves the importing Party's appropriate level of sanitary protection;
(iv) the determination by the importing Party of whether the exporting Party's sanitary measure(s) achieves its appropriate level of sanitary protection;
(v) the importing Party shall accept the sanitary measure(s) of the exporting Party as equivalent if the exporting Party objectively demonstrates that its measure(s) achieves the importing Party's appropriate level of protection.
2. Where equivalence has not been recognized, trade may take place under the conditions required by the importing Party to meet its appropriate level of protection as set out in Annex V. The exporting Party may agree to meet the importing Party's conditions, without prejudice to the result of the process set out in paragraph 1.
Recognition of sanitary measures
1. Annex V lists those sectors, or parts of sectors, for which, at the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the respective sanitary measures are recognized as equivalent for trade purposes. The Parties shall take the necessary legislative/administrative actions to implement recognition of equivalence to allow trade on that basis within three months.
2. Annex V also lists those sectors, or parts of sectors, for which the Parties apply differing sanitary measures and have not concluded the assessment provided for in Article 7. Based on the process described in Articles 7 and 8, the actions set out in Annex V shall be taken to enable the assessment to be completed by the indicative dates indicated therein. The Parties shall take the necessary legislative/administrative actions to implement recognition of equivalence within three months of the date of recognition. Pending recognition, trade shall take place under the conditions set out in Annex V.
3. Each consignment of live animals or animal products for which equivalence has been recognized presented for import will be accompanied, unless not required, by an official health certificate, the model attestation for which is prescribed in Annex VII. The Parties may jointly determine principles or guidelines for certification. Any such principles shall be included in Annex VII.
1. To maintain confidence in the effective implementation of the provisions of this Agreement, each Party shall have the right to carry out audit and verification procedures of the exporting Party, which may include:
(a) an assessment of all or part of the responsible authorities' total control programme, including, where appropriate, reviews of the inspection and audit programmes; and
These procedures shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of Annex VI.
2. Each Party shall also have the right to carry out frontier checks on consignments on importation, the results of which form part of the verification process.
3. For the Community:
- the Community shall carry out the audit and verification procedures provided for in paragraph 1,
- the Member States shall carry out the frontier checks provided for in paragraph 2.
4. For New Zealand, the New Zealand authorities shall carry out the audit and verification procedures and frontier checks provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2.
5. On the mutual consent of the Parties to this Agreement, either Party may:
(b) use the results and conclusions of the audit and verification procedures and frontier checks of countries that are not parties to this Agreement.
Frontier checks and inspection fees
1. The frequencies of frontier checks, as referred to in Article 10 (2), on imported live animals and animal products shall be as set out in Annex VIII A. The Parties may amend the frequencies, within their responsibilities, as appropriate as a result of progress made in accordance with Annex V and Annex IX, or as a result of other actions or consultations provided for in this Agreement.
2. The physical checks applied shall be based on the risk associated with such importations.
3. In the event that the checks reveal non-conformity with the relevant standards and/or requirements, the action taken by the importing Party should be based on an assessment of the risk involved. Wherever possible, the importer or his representative shall be given access to the consignment and the opportunity to contribute any relevant information to assist the importing Party in taking a final decision.
4. Inspection fees may be collected for the costs incurred in frontier checks. Provisions in relation to inspection fees are prescribed in Annex VIII B.
1. The Parties shall notify each other of:
- significant changes in health status such as the presence and evolution of diseases in Annex III within 24 hours,
- findings of epidemiological importance with respect to diseases which are not in Annex III or new diseases without delay,
- any additional measures beyond the basic requirements of their respective sanitary measures taken to control or eradicate animal disease or protect public health, and any changes in preventive policies, including vaccination policies.
2. The notifications referred to in paragraph 1 shall be made in writing to the contact points established in accordance with Article 15 (4).
3. In cases of serious and immediate concern with respect to public/animal health, oral notification shall be made to the contact points established in accordance with Article 15 (4), and written confirmation should follow within 24 hours.
4. Where either Party has serious concerns regarding a risk to animal or public health, consultations regarding the situation shall, on request, take place as soon as possible, and in any case within 14 days. Each Party shall endeavour in such situations to provide all the information necessary to avoid a disruption in trade, and to reach a mutually acceptable solution.
Without prejudice to Article 12, and in particular paragraph 4, either Party may, on serious public or animal health grounds, take provisional measures necessary for the protection of public or animal health. These measures shall be notified within 24 hours to the other Party and, on request, consultations regarding the situation shall be held within 14 days. The Parties shall take due account of any information provided through such consultations.
The principles of this Agreement shall also be applied to address outstanding issues falling within its scope affecting trade between the Parties in live animals and animal products as listed in Annex IX. Modifications shall be made to this Annex and, as appropriate, the other Annexes, to take account of progress made and new issues identified.
Information exchange and submission of scientific research and data
1. The Parties shall exchange information relevant to the implementation of this Agreement on a uniform and systematic basis, to provide assurance, engender mutual confidence and demonstrate the efficacy of the programmes controlled. Where appropriate, achievement of these objectives may be enhanced by exchanges of officials.
2. The information exchange on changes in their respective sanitary measures, and other relevant information, shall include:
- opportunity to consider proposals for changes in regulatory standards or requirements which may affect this Agreement in advance of their finalization. Where either Party considers it necessary, proposals may be dealt with in accordance with Article 16 (3),
- briefing on current developments affecting trade in live animals and animal products,
- information on the results of the verification procedures provided for in Article 10.

Article 55 Regional cooperation
As part of the implementation of economic cooperation in the various spheres, the Parties will encourage operations designed to develop cooperation between the Palestinian Authority and other Mediterranean partners, through technical support.
This cooperation will be an important element of the Community's support for the development of the region as a whole.
Priority will be given to operations aimed at:
- promoting intra-regional trade,
- developing regional cooperation on the environment,
- encouraging the development of the communications infrastructure required for the economic development of the region,

TITLE IV COOPERATION ON AUDIO-VISUAL AND CULTURAL MATTERS, INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION
The Parties shall promote cooperation in the audio-visual sector to their mutual benefit. The Parties shall seek ways of associating the Palestinian Authority with Community initiatives in this sector, thus enabling cooperation in areas such as co-production, training, development and distribution.
The Parties shall promote cultural cooperation. The area of cooperation may include Community activities concerning, in particular, translation, exchange of works of art and artists, conservation and restoration of historic and cultural monuments and sites, training of persons working in the cultural field, the organization of European-oriented cultural events, raising mutual awareness and contributing to the dissemination of information on outstanding cultural events.
The Parties will undertake to determine how to improve significantly the education and vocational training situation. To this end, the access of women to education, including technical courses, higher education and vocational training, will receive special attention.
In order to develop the level of expertise of senior staff in the public and private sectors, the Parties will step up their cooperation on education and vocational training and cooperation between universities and firms.
Preparing young people to become active citizens in democratic civil society should be actively promoted. Youth cooperation, including training of youth workers and youth leaders, youth exchanges and voluntary service activities, could therefore be supported and developed.
Special attention will be paid to operations and programmes which will enable permanent links (MED-CAMPUS, for instance) to be established between specialized bodies in the Community and in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, such as will encourage the pooling and exchange of experience and technical resources.
The Parties shall promote activities of mutual interest in the field of information and communication.
Cooperation shall be implemented in particular through:
(a) a regular dialogue between the Parties;
(b) regular exchange of information and ideas in every sector of cooperation including meetings of officials and experts;

(d) implementation of joint actions such as seminars and workshops;
(e) technical, administrative and regulatory assistance;
(f) the dissemination of information on cooperation activities.
TITLE V FINANCIAL COOPERATION
In order to achieve the objectives of this Agreement, a financial cooperation package shall be made available to the Palestinian Authority in accordance with the appropriate procedures and the financial resources required.
These procedures shall be agreed by both Parties using the most appropriate instruments after this Agreement has entered into force.
Financial cooperation shall focus on:
- responding to the economic repercussions for the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of the gradual introduction of a free trade area, notably by upgrading and restructuring industry,
- trade institutions which promote trading links with foreign markets,
- accompanying measures for policies implemented in the social sector,
- upgrading economic and social infrastructure,
- promoting private investment and job-creating activities in the productive sectors,
- promoting reforms designed to modernize the economy,
- urban and rural development,
- the setting-up and improvement of institutions necessary for the proper working of the Palestinian public administration and the advancement of democracy and human rights.
In order to ensure that a coordinated approach is adopted to any exceptional macro-economic and financial problems that might arise as a result of the implementation of this Agreement, the Parties shall use the regular economic dialogue provided for in Title III to give particular attention to monitoring trade and financial flows in relations between them.

AGREEMENT between the European Community and the Russian Federation on trade in textile products
hereinafter referred to as 'the Parties`,
DESIRING to promote, with a view to permanent cooperation and in conditions providing for predictability of trade, the mutual expansion and orderly and equitable development of trade in textile products between the European Community (hereinafter 'the Community`) and the Russian Federation (hereafter 'Russia`),
RESOLVED to take the fullest possible account of the serious economic and social problems at present affecting the textile industry in both the Community and Russia,
HAVING REGARD to the objectives and provisions of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States and the Russian Federation (hereinafter referred to as 'the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement`) which entered into force on 1 December 1997,
BEARING IN MIND Russia's process of accession to the Word Trade Organisation (WTO),
HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:
1. The Parties confirm that the provisions of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement shall apply to trade in the textile and clothing products (hereinafter referred to as 'textile products`) listed in Annex I save where this Agreement makes specific provision concerning such products.
2. The cooperation between the textile and clothing industries in the Community and in Russia and the elimination of the quantitative restrictions in trade in textiles and clothing is the fundamental objective of this Agreement.
3. All quantitative restrictions currently applied to trade in textile products originating in either Party shall be eliminated on 1 May 1998.
4. The Parties hereby agree that no new quantitative restrictions on trade between the Community and Russia in the textile and clothing products listed in Annex I shall be introduced save as is provided in this Agreement.
1. The classification of the products covered by this Agreement and imported into the Community is based on the tariff and statistical nomenclature of the Community (hereinafter called 'the Combined Nomenclature` or, in abbreviated form, 'CN`) and any amendments thereof. The products nomenclature of foreign economic activity (hereinafter called in abbreviated form 'TN VED SNG`) shall be applied to the classification of goods for imports of those products into Russia.
2. The Parties agree that the introduction of changes, such as changes in practices, rules, procedures, and categorisation of textile products, including those changes relating to the Harmonised System and the Combined Nomenclature and the TN VED SNG in respect of the products set out in Annex I should not affect the balance of rights and obligations between the Parties under this Agreement; should not adversely affect the access available to a Party; should not impede the full utilisation of such access, or disrupt trade under this Agreement. The Party initiating any such changes shall inform the other Party before their entry into force.
3. The origin of the products covered by this Agreement and imported into the Community shall be determined in accordance with the rules of origin in force in the Community. The origin of the products covered by this Agreement and imported into Russia shall be determined in accordance with the rules of origin in force in the Russian Federation.
The Parties shall notify each other of any amendments to the respective rules of origin.
1. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 4, imports of textile products from the territory of either Party may only be made subject to quantitative restraint in accordance with Article 17 of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.
2. For a period of three years following the date on which this Agreement enters into application:
- the level of any quantitative restraint fixed under the provisions referred to in paragraph 1 in respect of imports of textile products shall be set at a level not lower than the actual level of exports or imports from the Party concerned during the 12-month period terminating two months preceding the month in which the request for consultation was made or the date on which the measures were introduced,
- for those categories of textile products previously subject to quantitative limits and set out in Annex II, any quantitative restraint fixed under the provisions referred to in paragraph 1 for category of products shall be set at a level not lower than the level of the 1997 quota for the category in question and shall not be triggered until imports into the Community of products of Russian origin of that category have reached 5 % of the total imports into the Community for that category.
3. The Parties agree to consult fully, pursuant to Article 5 in the event of the application of this Article.
1. Circumvention by transhipment, re-routing, false declaration concerning country or place of origin, and falsification of official documents, frustrates the effective functioning of this Agreement. Accordingly, the Parties will establish the necessary legal provisions and/or administrative procedures to address and take action against such circumvention. The Parties, consistent with their domestic laws and procedures, will cooperate fully to address problems arising from circumvention.
2. Should either Party believe that this Agreement is being circumvented by transhipment, re-routing, false declaration concerning country or place of origin, or falsification of official documents, and that no, or inadequate, measures are being applied to address and/or to take action against such circumvention, the Party should consult with the other with a view to seeking a mutually satisfactory solution. Such consultations should be held promptly, and within 30 days when possible.
3. The Parties will take necessary action, consistent with their domestic laws and procedures, to prevent, to investigate and, where appropriate, to take legal and/or administrative action against circumvention practices within their territory. The Parties agree to cooperate fully, consistent with their domestic laws and procedures, in instances of circumvention or alleged circumvention of this Agreement, to establish the relevant facts in the places of import, export and, where applicable, transhipment. Such cooperation, consistent with domestic laws and procedures, will include: investigation of circumvention practices which increase restrained exports to the territory of the Party maintaining such restraints: exchange of documents, correspondence, reports and other relevant information to the extent available; and facilitation of plant visits and contacts, on request and on a case-by-case basis. The Party should endeavour to clarify the circumstances of any such instances of circumvention or alleged circumvention, including the respective roles of the exporters or importers involved.
4. Where, as a result of investigation, there is sufficient evidence that circumvention has occurred (e.g. where evidence is available concerning the country or place of true origin, and the circumstances of such circumvention) the Parties shall take appropriate action, to the extent necessary to address the problem. Also, where there is evidence of the involvement of the territory of either Party through which goods have been transhipped, such action may include the introduction of restraints with respect to the Party concerned. Any such actions, together with their timing and scope, may be taken after consultations held with a view to arriving at a mutually satisfactory solution between the Parties. The Parties may agree on other remedies in consultation.
5. False declaration concerning fibre content, quantities, description or classification of merchandise also frustrates the objective of this Agreement. Where there is evidence that any such false declaration has been made for purposes of circumvention, the Parties shall take appropriate measures, consistent with domestic laws and procedures against the exporters or importers involved. Should either Party believe that this Agreement is being circumvented by such false declaration and that no, or inadequate, administrative measures are being applied to address and/or to take action against such circumvention, that Party should consult promptly with the other with a view to seeking a mutually satisfactory solution. This provision is not intended to prevent Parties from making technical adjustments when inadvertent errors in declarations have been made.
6. In order to facilitate the cooperation provided for under this Article, Russia undertakes to issue automatic export authorisations according to the relevant Russian legislation in respect of exports of textile products previously subject to quantitative limits and set out in Annex II.
For those categories subject to the issue of export licences the competent authorities of the Community will issue import authorisations only on the presentation of export authorisations issued by the competent Russian authorities.
Russia undertakes to transmit, on a weekly basis, information on quantities covered by the automatic export authorisations referred to above. This may be carried out by way of an electronic linkage between the competent Russian authorities and the Système intégré de gestion de licences (hereinafter referred to as 'SIGL`) as established by the Community. The Community will ensure full technical and financial assistance in setting up such linkage, within the limits of TACIS programme.
In case of significant and unjustified discrepancies between the information received through the electronic linkage with SIGL and the export authorisations submitted to the competent authorities of the Community, either Party may request consultations under Article 5 of the Agreement in order to identify the reasons for the discrepancies. Should these discrepancies be due to fraudulent transhipment of products not originating in Russia the Parties will agree appropriate measures in order to avoid their recurrence.
This system of double checking shall be maintained for as long as both Parties so desire.
7. Following a request from one Party the other Party shall provide data on a monthly basis in respect of its exports of the specific categories of textile products exported to the Party making the request.
1. Save where it is otherwise provided, the special consultation procedures referred to in this Agreement shall be governed by the following rules:
- any request for consultations shall be notified in writing to the other Party,
- the request for consultation shall be followed within 15 days of the notification by a statement setting out the reasons and circumstances which, in the opinion of the requesting Party, justify the submission of such a request,
- the Parties shall enter into consultations within one month of notification of the request at the latest, with a view to reaching agreement or a mutually acceptable conclusion within one further month at the latest.
2. If necessary, at the request of either of the Parties, consultations shall be held on any problems arising from the application of this Agreement. Any consultations held under this Article shall take place in a spirit of cooperation and with a desire to reconcile the differences between the Parties.
1. This Agreement shall apply provisionally from the date of signature and shall enter into force on the first day of the month following the date on which the Parties notify each other of the completion of the procedures necessary for that purpose.
2. This Agreement shall be in force for the duration of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.
3. Either Party may at any time propose to hold consultations in accordance with Article 5 with a view to agreeing amendments to this Agreement.
4. Without prejudice to the removal of restrictions laid down by Article 1, the operation of this Agreement shall in any event be reviewed if Russia becomes a Member of the WTO during the validity of this Agreement.
5. Either Party may, at any time, denounce this Agreement by notifying the other Party in written form. This Agreement shall cease to apply six months after the date of such notification.
6. The Annexes attached to this Agreement shall form an integral part thereof.
This Agreement shall be drawn up in duplicate in the Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish and Russian languages, each of these texts being equally authentic.
AGREEMENT between the European Communities and the Government of the United States of America on the application of positive comity principles in the enforcement of their competition laws
THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY AND THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Having regard to the 23 September 1991 Agreement between the European Communities and the Government of the United States of America regarding the application of their competition laws, and the exchange of interpretative letters dated 31 May and 31 July 1995 in relation to that Agreement (together hereinafter 'the 1991 Agreement`),
Recognising that the 1991 Agreement has contributed to coordination, cooperation, and avoidance of conflicts in competition law enforcement,
Noting in particular Article V of the 1991 Agreement, commonly referred to as the 'positive comity` Article, which calls for cooperation regarding anti-competitive activities occurring in the territory of one Party that adversely affect the interests of the other Party,
Believing that further elaboration of the principles of positive comity and of the implementation of those principles would enhance the 1991 Agreement's effectiveness in relation to such conduct,
Noting that nothing in this Agreement or its implementation shall be construed as prejudicing either Party's position on issues of competition law jurisdiction in the international context,
HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:
Scope and purpose of this Agreement
1. This Agreement applies where a Party satisfies the other that there is reason to believe that the following circumstances are present:
(b) the activities in question are impermissible under the competition laws of the Party in the territory of which the activities are occurring.
2. The purposes of this Agreement are to:
(a) help ensure that trade and investment flows between the Parties and competition and consumer welfare within the territories of the parties are not impeded by anti-competitive activities for which the competition laws of one or both Parties can provide a remedy, and
As used in this Agreement:
1. 'Adverse effects` and 'adversely affected` mean harm caused by anti-competitive activities to:
(b) competition in a Party's domestic or import markets.
2. 'Requesting Party` means a Party that is adversely affected by anti-competitive activities occurring in whole or in substantial part in the territory of the other Party.
3. 'Requested Party` means a Party in the territory of which such anti-competitive activities appear to be occurring.
4. 'Competition law(s)` means
(a) for the European Communities, Articles 85, 86, and 89 of the Treaty establishing the European Community (EC), Articles 65 and 66(7) of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), and their implementing instruments, to the exclusion of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 on the control of concentrations between undertakings; and
as well as such other laws or regulations as the Parties shall jointly agree in writing to be a 'competition law` for the purposes of this Agreement.
5. 'Competition authorities` means:
(b) for the United States, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission.
6. 'Enforcement activities` means any application of competition law by way of investigation or proceeding conducted by the competition authorities of a Party.
7. 'Anti-competitive activities` means any conduct or transaction that is impermissible under the competition laws of a Party.
The competition authorities of a Requesting Party may request the competition authorities of a Requested Party to investigate and, if warranted, to remedy anti-competitive activities in accordance with the Requested Party's competition laws. Such a request may be made regardless of whether the activities also violate the Requesting Party's competition laws, and regardless of whether the competition authorities of the Requesting Party have commenced or contemplate taking enforcement activities under their own competition laws.
Deferral or suspension of investigations in reliance on enforcement activity by the Requested Party
1. The competition authorities of the Parties may agree that the competition authorities of the Requesting Party will defer or suspend pending or contemplated enforcement activities during the pendency of enforcement activities of the Requested Party.
2. The competition authorities of a Requesting Party will normally defer or suspend their own enforcement activities in favour of enforcement activities by the competition authorities of the Requested Party when the following conditions are satisfied:
(a) the anti-competitive activities at issue:
(i) do not have a direct, substantial and reasonably foreseeable impact on consumers in the Requesting Party's territory; or
(b) the adverse effects on the interests of the Requesting Party can be and are likely to be fully and adequately investigated and, as appropriate, eliminated or adequately remedied pursuant to the laws, procedures, and available remedies of the Requested Party. The Parties recognise that it may be appropriate to pursue separate enforcement activities where anti-competitive activities affecting both territories justify the imposition of penalties within both jurisdictions; and
(c) the competition authorities of the Requested Party agree that in conducting their own enforcement activities, they will:
(i) devote adequate resources to investigate the anti-competitive activities and, where appropriate, promptly pursue adequate enforcement activities;
(ii) use their best efforts to pursue all reasonably available sources of information, including such sources of information as may be suggested by the competition authorities of the Requesting Party;
(iii) inform the competition authorities of the Requesting Party, on request or at reasonable intervals, of the status of their enforcement activities and intentions, and where appropriate provide to the competition authorities of the Requesting Party relevant confidential information if consent has been obtained from the source concerned. The use and disclosure of such information shall be governed by Article V;
(iv) promptly notify the competition authorities of the Requesting Party of any change in their intentions with respect to investigation or enforcement;
(v) use their best efforts to complete their investigation and to obtain a remedy or initiate proceedings within six months, or such other time as agreed to by the competition authorities of the Parties, of the deferral or suspension of enforcement activities by the competition authorities of the Requesting Party;
(vi) fully inform the competition authorities of the Requesting Party of the results of their investigation, and take into account the views of the competition authorities of the Requesting Party, prior to any settlement, initiation of proceedings, adoption of remedies, or termination of the investigation; and
(vii) comply with any reasonable request that may be made by the competition authorities of the Requesting Party.
When the above conditions are satisfied, a Requesting Party which chooses not to defer or suspend its enforcement activities shall inform the competition authorities of the Requested Party of its reasons.
3. The competition authorities of the Requesting Party may defer or suspend their own enforcement activities if fewer than all of the conditions set out in paragraph 2 are satisfied.
4. Nothing in this Agreement precludes the competition authorities of a Requesting Party that choose to defer or suspend independent enforcement activities from later initiating or such activities. In such circumstances, the competition authorities of the Requesting Party will promptly inform the competition authorities of the Requested Party of their intentions and reasons. If the competition authorities of the Requested Party continue with their own investigation, the competition authorities of the two Parties shall, where appropriate, coordinate their respective investigations under the criteria and procedures of Article IV of the 1991 Agreement.
Confidentiality and use of information
Where pursuant to this Agreement the competition authorities of one Party provide information to the competition authorities of the other Party for the purpose of implementing this Agreement, that information shall be used by the latter competition authorities only for that purpose. However, the competition authorities that provided the information may consent to another use, on condition that where confidential information has been provided pursuant to Article IV(2)(c)(iii) on the basis of the consent of the source concerned, that source also agrees to the other use. Disclosure of such information shall be governed by the provisions of Article VIII of the 1991 Agreement and the exchange of interpretative letters dated 31 May and 31 July 1995.
Relationship to the 1991 Agreement
This Agreement shall supplement and be interpreted consistently with the 1991 Agreement, which remains fully in force.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with the existing laws, or as requiring any change in the laws, of the European Communities or the United States of America or of their respective Member States or states.
Entry into force and termination
1. This Agreement shall enter into force upon signature.
2. This Agreement shall remain in force until 60 days after the date on which either Party notifies the other Party in writing that it wishes to terminate the Agreement.
AGREEMENT on the implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks
THE STATES PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT,
RECALLING the relevant provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982,
DETERMINED to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks,
RESOLVED to improve cooperation between States to that end,
CALLING for more effective enforcement by flag States, port States and coastal States of the conservation and management measures adopted for such stocks,
SEEKING to address in particular the problems identified in Chapter 17, programme area C, of Agenda 21 adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, namely, that the management of high seas fisheries is inadequate in many areas and that some resources are over-utilised; noting that there are problems of unregulated fishing, over-capitalisation, excessive fleet size, vessel reflagging to escape controls, insufficiently selective gear, unreliable databases and lack of sufficient cooperation between States,
COMMITTING themselves to responsible fisheries,
CONSCIOUS of the need to avoid adverse impacts on the marine environment, preserve biodiversity, maintain the integrity of marine ecosystems and minimise the risk of long-term or irreversible effects of fishing operations,
RECOGNISING the need for specific assistance, including financial, scientific and technological assistance, in order that developing States can participate effectively in the conservation, management and sustainable use of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks,
CONVINCED that an agreement for the implementation of the relevant provisions of the Convention would best serve these purposes and contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security,
AFFIRMING that matters not regulated by the Convention or by this Agreement continue to be governed by the rules and principles of general international law,
HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:
(b) 'conservation and management measures` means measures to conserve and manage one or more species of living marine resources that are adopted and applied consistent with the relevant rules of international law as reflected in the Convention and this Agreement;
(c) 'fish` includes molluscs and crustaceans except those belonging to sedentary species as defined in Article 77 of the Convention; and
2. (a) 'States Parties` means States which have consented to be bound by this Agreement and for which the Agreement is in force.
(b) This Agreement applies mutatis mutandis:
(i) to any entity referred to in Article 305(1)(c), (d) and (e), of the Convention and
which becomes a Party to this Agreement, and to that extent 'States Parties` refers to those entities.
3. This Agreement applies mutatis mutandis to other fishing entities whose vessels fish on the high seas.
The objective of this Agreement is to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks through effective implementation of the relevant provisions of the Convention.
1. Unless otherwise provided, this Agreement applies to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks beyond areas under national jurisdiction, except that Articles 6 and 7 apply also to the conservation and management of such stocks within areas under national jurisdiction, subject to the different legal regimes that apply within areas under national jurisdiction and in areas beyond national jurisdiction as provided for in the Convention.
2. In the exercise of its sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks within areas under national jurisdiction, the coastal State shall apply mutatis mutandis the general principles enumerated in Article 5.
3. States shall give due consideration to the respective capacities of developing States to apply Articles 5, 6 and 7 within areas under national jurisdiction and their need for assistance as provided for in this Agreement. To this end, Part VII applies mutatis mutandis in respect of areas under national jurisdiction.
Relationship between this Agreement and the Convention
Nothing in this Agreement shall prejudice the rights, jurisdiction and duties of States under the Convention. This Agreement shall be interpreted and applied in the context of and in a manner consistent with the Convention.
CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF STRADDLING FISH STOCKS AND HIGHLY MIGRATORY FISH STOCKS
In order to conserve and manage straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, coastal States and States fishing on the high seas shall, in giving effect to their duty to cooperate in accordance with the Convention:
(a) adopt measures to ensure long-term sustainability of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks and promote the objective of their optimum utilisation;
(b) ensure that such measures are based on the best scientific evidence available and are designed to maintain or restore stocks at levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield, as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors, including the special requirements of developing States, and taking into account fishing patterns, the interdependence of stocks and any generally recommended international minimum standards, whether subregional, regional or global;
(c) apply the precautionary approach in accordance with Article 6;
(d) assess the impacts of fishing, other human activities and environmental factors on target stocks and species belonging to the same ecosystem or associated with or dependent on the target stocks;
(e) adopt, where necessary, conservation and management measures for species belonging to the same ecosystem or associated with or dependent on the target stocks, with a view to maintaining or restoring populations of such species above levels at which their reproduction may become seriously threatened;
(f) minimise pollution, waste, discards, catch by lost or abandoned gear, catch of non-target species, both fish and non-fish species, (hereinafter referred to as 'non-target species`) and impacts on associated or dependent species, in particular endangered species, through measures including, to the extent practicable, the development and use of selective, environmentally safe and cost-effective fishing gear and techniques;
(g) protect biodiversity in the marine environment;
(h) take measures to prevent or eliminate overfishing and excess fishing capacity and to ensure that levels of fishing effort do not exceed those commensurate with the sustainable use of fishery resources;
(i) take into account the interests of artisanal and subsistence fishers;
(j) collect and share, in a timely manner, complete and accurate data concerning fishing activities on, inter alia, vessel position, catch of target and non-target species and fishing effort, as set out in Annex I, as well as information from national and international research programmes;
(k) promote and conduct scientific research and develop appropriate technologies in support of fishery conservation and management, and
Application of the precautionary approach
1. States shall apply the precautionary approach widely to conservation, management and exploitation of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks in order to protect the living marine resources and preserve the marine environment.
2. States shall be more cautions when information is uncertain, unreliable or inadequate. The absence of adequate scientific information shall not be used as a reason for postponing or failing to take conservation and management measures.
3. In implementing the precautionary approach, States shall:
(a) improve decision-making for fishery resource conservation and management by obtaining and sharing the best scientific information available and implementing improved techniques for dealing with risk and uncertainty;
(b) apply the guidelines set out in Annex II and determine, on the basis of the best scientific information available, stock-specific reference points and the action to be taken if they are exceeded;
(c) take into account, inter alia, uncertainties relating to the size and productivity of the stocks, reference points, stock condition in relation to such reference points, levels and distribution of fishing mortality and the impact of fishing activities on non-target and associated or dependent species, as well as existing and predicted oceanic, environmental and socioeconomic conditions, and
(d) develop data-collection and research programmes to assess the impact of fishing on non-target and associated or dependent species and their environment, and adopt plans which are necessary to ensure the conservation of such species and to protect habitats of special concern.
4. State shall take measures to ensure that, when reference points are approached, they will not be exceeded. In the event that they are exceeded, States shall, without delay, take the action determined under paragraph 3(b) to restore the stocks.
5. Where the status of target stocks or non-target or associated or dependent species is of concern, States shall subject such stocks and species to enhanced monitoring in order to review their status and the efficacy of conservation and management measures. They shall revise those measures regularly in the light of new information.
6. For new or exploratory fisheries, States shall adopt as soon as possible cautious conservation and management measures, including, inter alia, catch limits and effort limits. Such measures shall remain in force until there are sufficient data to allow assessment of the impact of the fisheries on the long-term sustainability of the stocks, whereupon conservation and management measures based on that assessment shall be implemented. The latter measures shall, if appropriate, allow for the gradual development of the fisheries.
7. If a natural phenomenon has a significant adverse impact on the status of straddling fish stocks or highly migratory fish stocks, States shall adopt conservation and management measures on an emergency basis to ensure that fishing activity does not exacerbate such adverse impact. States shall also adopt such measures on an emergency basis where fishing activity presents a serious threat to the sustainability of such stocks. Measures taken on an emergency basis shall be temporary and shall be based on the best scientific evidence available.
Compatibility of conservation and management measures
1. Without prejudice to the sovereign rights of coastal States for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing the living marine resources within areas under national jurisdiction as provided for in the Convention, and the right of all States for their nationals to engage in fishing on the high seas in accordance with the Convention:
(a) with respect to straddling fish stocks, the relevant coastal States and the States whose nationals fish for such stocks in the adjacent high seas area shall seek, either directly or through the appropriate mechanisms for cooperation provided for in Part III, to agree upon the measures necessary for the conservation of these stocks in the adjacent high seas area;
(b) with respect to highly migratory fish stocks, the relevant coastal States and other States whose nationals fish for such stocks in the region shall cooperate, either directly or through the appropriate mechanisms for cooperation provided for in Part III, with a view to ensuring conservation and promoting the objective of optimum utilisation of such stocks throughout the region, both within and beyond the areas under national jurisdiction.
2. Conservation and management measures established for the high seas and those adopted for areas under national jurisdiction shall be compatible in order to ensure conservation and management of the straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks in their entirety. To this end, coastal States and States fishing on the high seas have a duty to cooperate for the purpose of achieving compatible measures in respect of such stocks. In determining compatible conservation and management measures, States shall:
(a) take into account the conservation and management measures adopted and applied in accordance with Article 61 of the Convention in respect of the same stocks by coastal States within areas under national jurisdiction and ensure that measures established in respect of such stocks for the high seas do not undermine the effectiveness of such measures;
(b) take into account previously agreed measures established and applied for the high seas in accordance with the Convention in respect of the same stocks by relevant coastal States and States fishing on the high seas;
(c) take into account previously agreed measures established and applied in accordance with the Convention in respect of the same stocks by a subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement;
(d) take into account the biological unity and other biological characteristics of the stocks and the relationships between the distribution of the stocks, the fisheries and the geographical particularities of the region concerned, including the extent to which the stocks occur and are fished in areas under national jurisdiction;
(f) ensure that such measures do not result in harmful impact on the living marine resources as a whole.
3. In giving effect to their duty to cooperate, States shall make every effort to agree on compatible conservation and management measures within a reasonable period of time.
4. If no agreement can be reached within a reasonable period of time, any of the States concerned may invoke the procedures for the settlement of disputes provided for in Part VIII.
5. Pending agreement on compatible conservation and management measures, the States concerned, in a spirit of understanding and cooperation, shall make every effort to enter into provisional arrangements of a practical nature. In the event that they are unable to agree on such arrangements, any of the States concerned may, for the purpose of obtaining provisional measures, submit the dispute to a court or tribunal in accordance with the procedures for the settlement of disputes provided for in Part VIII.
6. Provisional arrangements or measures entered into or prescribed pursuant to paragraph 5 shall take into account the provisions of this Part, shall have due regard to the rights and obligations of all States concerned, shall not jeopardize or hamper the reaching of final agreement on compatible conservation and management measures and shall be without prejudice to the final outcome of any dispute settlement procedure.
7. Coastal States shall regularly inform States fishing on the high seas in the subregion or region, either directly or through appropriate subregional or regional fisheries management organisations or arrangements, or through other appropriate means, of the measures they have adopted for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks within areas under their national jurisdiction.
8. States fishing on the high seas shall regularly inform other interested States, either directly or through appropriate subregional or regional fisheries management organisations or arrangements, or through other appropriate means, of the measures they have adopted for regulating the activities of vessels flying their flag which fish for such stocks on the high seas.
MECHANISMS FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION CONCERNING STRADDLING FISH STOCKS AND HIGHLY MIGRATORY FISH STOCKS
Cooperation for conservation and management
1. Coastal States and States fishing on the high seas shall, in accordance with the Convention, pursue cooperation in relation to straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks either directly or through appropriate subregional or regional fisheries management organisations or arrangements, taking into account the specific characteristics of the subregion or region, to ensure effective conservation and management of such stocks.
2. States shall enter into consultations in good faith and without delay, particularly where there is evidence that the straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks concerned may be under threat of overexploitation or where a new fishery is being developed for such stocks. To this end, consultations may be initiated at the request of any interested State with a view to establishing appropriate arrangements to ensure conservation and management of the stocks. Pending agreement on such arrangements, States shall observe the provisions of this Agreement and shall act in good faith and with due regard to the rights, interests and duties of other States.
3. Where a subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement has the competence to establish conservation and management measures for particular straddling fish stocks or highly migratory fish stocks, States fishing for the stocks on the high seas and relevant coastal States shall give effect to their duty to cooperate by becoming members of such organisation or participants in such arrangement, or by agreeing to apply the conservation and management measures established by such organisation or arrangement. States having a real interest in the fisheries concerned may become members of such organisation or participants in such arrangement. The terms of participation in such organisation or arrangement shall not preclude such States from membership or participation; nor shall they be applied in a manner which discriminates against any State or group of States having a real interest in the fisheries concerned.
4. Only those States which are members of such an organisation or participants in such an arrangement, or which agree to apply the conservation and management measures established by such organisation or arrangement, shall have access to the fishery resources to which those measures apply.
5. Where there is no subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement to establish conservation and management measures for a particular straddling fish stock or highly migratory fish stock, relevant coastal States and States fishing on the high seas for such stock in the subregion or region shall cooperate to establish such an organisation or enter into other appropriate arrangements to ensure conservation and management of such stock and shall participate in the work of the organisation or arrangement.
6. Any State intending to propose that action be taken by an intergovernmental organisation having competence with respect to living resources should, where such action would have a significant effect on conservation and management measures already established by a competent subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement, consult through that organisation or arrangement with its members or participants. To the extent practicable, such consultation should take place prior to the submission of the proposal to the intergovernmental organisation.
Subregional and regional fisheries management organisations and arrangements
1. In establishing subregional or regional fisheries management organisations or in entering into subregional or regional fisheries management arrangements for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, States shall agree, inter alia, on:
(a) the stocks to which conservation and management measures apply, taking into account the biological characteristics of the stocks concerned and the nature of the fisheries involved;
(b) the area of application, taking into account Article 7(1), and the characteristics of the subregion or region, including socioeconomic, geographical and environmental factors;
(c) the relationship between the work of the new organisation or arrangement and the role, objectives and operations of any relevant existing fisheries management organisations or arrangements, and
(d) the mechanisms by which the organisation or arrangement will obtain scientific advice and review the status of the stocks, including, where appropriate, the establishment of a scientific advisory body.
2. States cooperating in the formation of a subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement shall inform other States which they are aware have a real interest in the work of the proposed organisation or arrangement of such cooperation.
Functions of subregional and regional fisheries management organisations and arrangements
In fulfilling their obligation to cooperate through subregional or regional fisheries management organisations or arrangements, States shall:
(a) agree on and comply with conservation and management measures to ensure the long-term sustainability of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks;
(b) agree, as appropriate, on participatory rights such as allocations of allowable catch or levels of fishing effort;
(c) adopt and apply any generally recommended international minimum standards for the responsible conduct of fishing operations;
(d) obtain and evaluate scientific advice, review the status of the stocks and assess the impact of fishing on non-target and associated or dependent species;
(e) agree on standards for collection, reporting, verification and exchange of data on fisheries for the stocks;
(f) compile and disseminate accurate and complete statistical data, as described in Annex I, to ensure that the best scientific evidence is available, while maintaining confidentiality where appropriate;
(g) promote and conduct scientific assessments of the stocks and relevant research and disseminate the results thereof;
(h) establish appropriate cooperative mechanisms for effective monitoring, control, surveillance and enforcement;
(i) agree on means by which the fishing interests of new members of the organisation or new participants in the arrangement will be accommodated;
(j) agree on decision-making procedures which facilitate the adoption of conservation and management measures in a timely and effective manner;
(k) promote the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with Part VIII;
(m) give due publicity to the conservation and management measures established by the organisation or arrangement.
New members or participants
In determining the nature and extent of participatory rights for new members of a subregional or regional fisheries management organisation, or for new participants in a subregional or regional fisheries management arrangement, States shall take into account, inter alia:
(a) the status of the straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks and the existing level of fishing effort in the fishery;
(b) the respective interests, fishing patterns and fishing practices of new and existing members or participants;
(c) the respective contributions of new and existing members or participants to conservation and management of the stocks, to the collection and provision of accurate data and to the conduct of scientific research on the stocks;
(d) the needs of coastal fishing communities which are dependent mainly on fishing for the stocks;
(e) the needs of coastal States whose economies are overwhelmingly dependent on the exploitation of living marine resources, and
(f) the interests of developing States from the subregion or region in whose areas of national jurisdiction the stocks also occur.
Transparency in activities of subregional and regional fisheries management organisations and arrangements.
1. States shall provide for transparency in the decision-making process and other activities of subregional and regional fisheries management organisations and arrangements.
2. Representatives from other intergovernmental organisations and representatives from non-governmental organisations concerned with straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks shall be afforded the opportunity to take part in meetings of subregional and regional fisheries management organisations and arrangements as observers or otherwise, as appropriate, in accordance with the procedures of the organisation or arrangement concerned. Such procedures shall not be unduly restrictive in this respect. Such intergovernmental organisations and non-governmental organisations shall have timely access to the records and reports of such organisations and arrangements, subject to the procedural rules on access to them.
Strengthening of existing organisations and arrangements
States shall cooperate to strengthen existing subregional and regional fisheries management organisations and arrangements in order to improve their effectiveness in establishing and implementing conservation and management measures for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.
Collection and provision of information and cooperation in scientific research
1. States shall ensure that fishing vessels flying their flag provide such information as may be necessary in order to fulfil their obligations under this Agreement. To this end, States shall in accordance with Annex I:
(a) collect and exchange scientific, technical and statistical data with respect to fisheries for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks;
(c) take appropriate measures to verify the accuracy of such data.
2. States shall cooperate, either directly or through subregional or regional fisheries management organisations or arrangements:
(a) to agree on the specification of data and the format in which they are to be provided to such organisations or arrangements, taking into account the nature of the stocks and the fisheries for those stocks, and
3. Consistent with Part XIII of the Convention, States shall cooperate, either directly or through competent international organisations, to strengthen scientific research capacity in the field of fisheries and promote scientific research related to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks for the benefit of all. To this end, a State or the competent international organisation conducting such research beyond areas under national jurisdiction shall actively promote the publication and dissemination to any interested States of the results of that research and information relating to its objectives and methods and, to the extent practicable, shall facilitate the participation of scientists from those States in such research.
Enclosed and semi-enclosed seas
In implementing this Agreement in an enclosed or semi-enclosed sea, States shall take into account the natural characteristics of that sea and shall also act in a manner consistent with Part IX of the Convention and other relevant provisions thereof.
Areas of high seas surrounded entirely by an area under the national jurisdiction of a single State
1. States fishing for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks in an area of the high seas surrounded entirely by an area under the national jurisdiction of a single State and the latter State shall cooperate to establish conservation and management measures in respect of those stocks in the high seas area. Having regard to the natural characteristics of the area, States shall pay special attention to the establishment of compatible conservation and management measures for such stocks pursuant to Article 7. Measures taken in respect of the high seas shall take into account the rights, duties and interests of the coastal State under the Convention, shall be based on the best scientific evidence available and shall also take into account any conservation and management measures adopted and applied in respect of the same stocks in accordance with Article 61 of the Convention by the coastal State in the area under national jurisdiction. States shall also agree on measures for monitoring, control, surveillance and enforcement to ensure compliance with the conservation and management measures in respect of the high seas.
2. Pursuant to Article 8, States shall act in good faith and make every effort to agree without delay on conservation and management measures to be applied in the carrying out of fishing operations in the area referred to in paragraph 1. If, within a reasonable period of time, the fishing States concerned and the coastal State are unable to agree on such measures, they shall, having regard to paragraph 1, apply Article 7(4)(5) and (6) relating to provisional arrangements or measures. Pending the establishment of such provisional arrangements or measures, the States concerned shall take measures in respect of vessels flying their flag in order that they not engage in fisheries which could undermine the stocks concerned.
Non-members of organisations and non-participants in arrangements
1. A State which is not a member of a subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or is not a participant in a subregional or regional fisheries management arrangement, and which does not otherwise agree to apply the conservation and management measures established by such organisation or arrangment, is not discharged from the obligation to cooperate, in accordance with the Convention and this Agreement, in the conservation and management of the relevant straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.
2. Such State shall not authorise vessels flying its flag to engage in fishing operations for the straddling fish stocks or highly migratory fish stocks which are subject to the conservation and management measures established by such organisation or arrangement.
3. States which are members of a subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or participants in a subregional or regional fisheries management arrangement shall, individually or jointly, request the fishing entities referred to in Article 1(3) which have fishing vessels in the relevant area to cooperate fully with such organisation or arrangement in implementing the conservation and management measures it has established, with a view to having such measures applied de facto as extensively as possible to fishing activities in the relevant area. Such fishing entities shall enjoy benefits from participation in the fishery commensurate with their commitment to comply with conservation and management measures in respect of the stocks.
4. States which are members of such organisation or participants in such arrangement shall exchange information with respect to the activities of fishing vessels flying the flags of States which are neither members of the organisation nor participants in the arrangement and which are engaged in fishing operations for the relevant stocks. They shall take measures consistent with this Agreement and international law to deter activities of such vessels which undermine the effectiveness of subregional or regional conservation and management measures.
DUTIES OF THE FLAG STATE
Duties of the flag State
1. A State whose vessels fish on the high seas shall take such measures as may be necessary to ensure that vessels flying its flag comply with subregional and regional conservation and management measures and that such vessels do not engage in any activity which undermines the effectiveness of such measures.
2. A State shall authorise the use of vessels flying its flag for fishing on the high seas only where it is able to exercise effectively its responsibilities in respect of such vessels under the Convention and this Agreement.
3. Measures to be taken by a State in respect of vessels flying its flag shall include:
(a) control of such vessels on the high seas by mens of fishing licences, authorisations or permits, in accordance with any applicable procedures agreed at the subregional, regional or global level;
(b) establishment of regulations:
(i) to apply terms and conditions to the licence, authorisation or permit sufficient to fulfil any subregional, regional or global obligations of the flag State,
(ii) to prohibit fishing on the high seas by vessels which are not duly licensed or authorised to fish, or fishing on the high seas by vessels otherwise than in accordance with the terms and conditions of a licence, authorisation or permit,
(iv) to ensure that vessels flying its flag do not conduct unauthorised fishing within areas under the national jurisdiction of other States;
(c) establishment of a national record of fishing vessels authorised to fish on the high seas and provision of access to the information contained in that record on request by directly interested States, taking into account any national laws of the flag State regarding the release of such information;
(d) requirements for marking of fishing vessels and fishing gear for identification in accordance with uniform and internationally recognisable vessel and gear marking systems, such as the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations Standard Specifications for the Marking and Identification of Fishing Vessels;
(e) requirements for recording and timely reporting of vessel position, catch of target and non-target species, fishing effort and other relevant fisheries data in accordance with subregional, regional and global standards for collection of such data;
(f) requirements for verifying the catch of target and non-target species through such means as observer programmes, inspection schemes, unloading reports, supervision of transhipment and monitoring of landed catches and market statistics;
(g) monitoring, control and surveillance of such vessels, their fishing operations and related activities by, inter alia:
(i) the implementation of national inspection schemes and subregional and regional schemes for cooperation in enforcement pursuant to Articles 21 and 22, including requirements for such vessels to permit access by duly authorised inspectors from other States,
(iii) the development and implementation of vessel monitoring systems, including, as appropriate, satellite transmitter systems, in accordance with any national programmes and those which have been subregionally, regionally or globally agreed among the States concerned;
(h) regulation of transhipment on the high seas to ensure that the effectiveness of conservation and management measures is not undermined;
4. Where there is a subregionally, regionally or globally agreed system of monitoring, control and surveillance in effect, States shall ensure that the measures they impose on vessels flying their flag are compatible with that system.
Compliance and enforcement by the flag State
1. A State shall ensure compliance by vessels flying its flag with subregional and regional conservation and management measures for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks. To this end, that State shall:
(a) enforce such measures irrespective of where violations occur;
(b) investigate immediately and fully any alleged violation of subregional or regional conservation and management measures, which may include the physical inspection of the vessels concerned, and report promptly to the State alleging the violation and the relevant subregional or regional organisation or arrangements on the progress and outcome of the investigation;
(c) require any vessel flying its flag to give information to the investigating authority regarding vessel position, catches, fishing gear, fishing operations and related activities in the area of an alleged violation;
(e) ensure that, where it has been established, in accordance with its laws, a vessel has been involved in the commission of a serious violation of such measures, the vessel does not engage in fishing operations on the high seas until such time as all outstanding sanctions imposed by the flag State in respect of the violation have been complied with.
2. All investigations and judicial proceedings shall be carried out expeditiously. Sanctions applicable in respect of violations shall be adequate in severity to be effective in securing compliance and to discourage violations wherever they occur and shall deprive offenders of the benefits accruing from their illegal activities. Measures applicable in respect of masters and other officers of fishing vessels shall include provisions which may permit, inter alia, refusal, withdrawal or suspension of authorisations to serve as masters or officers on such vessels.
International cooperation in enforcement
1. States shall cooperate, either directly or through subregional or regional fisheries management organisations or arrangements, to ensure compliance with and enforcement of subregional and regional conservation and management measures for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.
2. A flag State conducting an investigation of an alleged violation of conservation and management measures for straddling fish stocks or highly migratory fish stocks may request the assistance of any other State whose cooperation may be useful in the conduct of that investigation. All States shall endeavour to meet reasonable requests made by a flag State in connection with such investigations.
3. A flag State may undertake such investigations directly, in cooperation with other interested States or through the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement. Information on the progress and outcome of the investigations shall be provided to all States having an interest in, or affected by, the alleged violation.
4. States shall assist each other in identifying vessels reported to have engaged in activities undermining the effectiveness of subregional, regional or global conservation and management measures.
5. States shall, to the extent permitted by national laws and regulations, establish arrangements for making available to prosecuting authorities in other States evidence relating to alleged violations of such measures.
6. Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that a vessel on the high seas has been engaged in unauthorised fishing within an area under the jurisdiction of a coastal State, the flag State of that vessel, at the request of the coastal State concerned, shall immediately and fully investigate the matter. The flag State shall cooperate with the coastal State in taking appropriate enforcement action in such cases and may authorise the relevant authorities of the coastal State to board and inspect the vessel on the high seas. This paragraph is without prejudice to Article 111 of the Convention.
7. States Parties which are members of a subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or participants in a subregional or regional fisheries management arrangement may take action in accordance with international law, including through recourse to subregional or regional procedures established for this purpose, to deter vessels which have engaged in activities which undermine the effectiveness of or otherwise violate the conservation and management measures established by that organisation or arrangement from fishing on the high seas in the subregion or region until such time as appropriate action is taken by the flag State.
Subregional and regional cooperation in enforcement
1. In any high seas area covered by a subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement, a State Party which is a member of such organisation or a participant in such arrangement may, through its duly authorised inspectors, board and inspect, in accordance with paragraph 2, fishing vessels flying the flag of another State Party to this Agreement, whether or not such State Party is also a member of the organisation or a participant in the arrangement, for the purpose of ensuring compliance with conservation and management measures for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks established by that organisation or arrangement.
2. States shall establish, through subregional or regional fisheries management organisations or arrangements, procedures for boarding and inspection pursuant to paragraph 1, as well as procedures to implement other provisions of this Article. Such procedures shall be consistent with this Article and the basic procedures set out in Article 22 and shall not discriminate against non-members of the organisation or non-participants in the arrangement. Boarding and inspection as well as any subsequent enforcement action shall be conducted in accordance with such procedures. States shall give due publicity to procedures established pursuant to this paragraph.
3. If, within two years of the adoption of this Agreement, any organisation or arrangement has not established such procedures, boarding and inspection pursuant to paragraph 1, as well as any subsequent enforcement action, shall, pending the establishment of such procedures, be conducted in accordance with this Article and the basic procedures set out in Article 22.
4. Prior to taking action under this Article, inspecting States shall, either directly or through the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement, inform all States whose vessels fish on the high seas in the subregion or region of the form of identification issued to their duly authorised inspectors. The vessels used for boarding and inspection shall be clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service. At the time of becoming a Party to this Agreement, a State shall designate an appropriate authority to receive notifications pursuant to this Article and shall give due publicity of such designation through the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement.
5. Where, following a boarding and inspection, there are clear grounds for believing that a vessel has engaged in any activity contrary to the conservation and management measures referred to in paragraph 1, the inspecting State shall, where appropriate, secure evidence and shall promptly notify the flag State of the alleged violation.
6. The flag State shall respond to the notification referred to in paragraph 5 within three working days of its receipt, or such other period as may be prescribed in procedures established in accordance with paragraph 2, and shall either:
(b) authorise the inspecting State to investigate.
7. Where the flag State authorises the inspecting State to investigate an alleged violation, the inspecting State shall, without delay, communicate the results of that investigation to the flag State. The flag State shall, if evidence so warrants, fulfil its obligations to take enforcement action with respect to the vessel. Alternatively, the flag State may authorise the inspecting State to take such enforcement action as the flag State may specify with respect to the vessel, consistent with the rights and obligations of the flag State under this Agreement.
8. Where, following boarding and inspection, there are clear grounds for believing that a vessel has committed a serious violation, and the flag State has either failed to respond or failed to take action as required under paragraphs 6 or 7, the inspectors may remain on board and secure evidence and may require the master to assist in further investigation including, where appropriate, by bringing the vessel without delay to the nearest appropriate port, or to such other port as may be specified in procedures established in accordance with paragraph 2. The inspecting State shall immediately inform the flag State of the name of the port to which the vessel is to proceed. The inspecting State and the flag State and, as appropriate, the port State shall take all necessary steps to ensure the well-being of the crew regardless of their nationality.
9. The inspecting State shall inform the flag State and the relevant organisation or the participants in the relevant arrangement of the results of any further investigation.
10. The inspecting State shall require its inspectors to observe generally accepted international regulations, procedures and practices relating to the safety of the vessel and the crew, minimise interference with fishing operations and, to the extent practicable, avoid action which would adversely affect the quality of the catch on board. The inspecting State shall ensure that boarding and inspection is not conducted in a manner that would constitute harassment of any fishing vessel.
11. For the purposes of this Article, a serious violation means:
(a) fishing without a valid licence, authorisation or permit issued by the flag State in accordance with Article 18(3)(a);
(b) failing to maintain accurate records of catch and catch-related data, as required by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement, or serious misreporting of catch, contrary to the catch reporting requirements of such organisation or arrangement;
(c) fishing in a closed area, fishing during a closed season or fishing without, or after attainment of, a quota established by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement;
(d) directed fishing for a stock which is subject to a moratorium or for which fishing is prohibited;
(e) using prohibited fishing gear;
(f) falsifying or concealing the markings, identity or registration of a fishing vessel;
(g) concealing, tampering with or disposing of evidence relating to an investigation;
(h) multiple violations which together constitute a serious disregard of conservation and management measures; or
12. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article, the flag State may, at any time, take action to fulfil its obligations under Article 19 with respect to an alleged violation. Where the vessel is under the direction of the inspecting State, the inspecting State shall, at the request of the flag State, release the vessel to the flag State along with full information on the progress and outcome of its investigation.
13. This Article is without prejudice to the right of the flag State to take any measures, including proceedings to impose penalties, according to its laws.
14. This Article applies mutatis mutandis to boarding and inspection by a State Party which is a member of a subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or a participant in a subregional or regional fisheries management arrangement and which has clear grounds for believing that a fishing vessel flying the flag of another State Party has engaged in any activity contrary to relevant conservation and management measures referred to in paragraph 1 in the high seas area covered by such organisation or arrangement, and such vessel has subsequently, during the same fishing trip, entered into an area under the national jurisdiction of the inspecting State.
15. Where a subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement has established an alternative mechanism which effectively discharges the obligation under this Agreement of its members or participants to ensure compliance with the conservation and management measures established by the organisation or arrangement, members of such organisation or participants in such arrangement may agree to limit the application of paragraph 1 as between themselves in respect of the conservation and management measures which have been established in the relevant high seas area.
16. Action taken by States other than the flag State in respect of vessels having engaged in activities contrary to subregional or regional conservation and management measures shall be proportionate to the seriousness of the violation.
17. Where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a fishing vessel on the high seas is without nationality, a State may board and inspect the vessel. Where evidence so warrants, the State may take such action as may be appropriate in accordance with international law.
18. States shall be liable for damage or loss attributable to them arising from action taken pursuant to this Article when such action is unlawful or exceeds that reasonably required in the light of available information to implement the provisions of this Article.
Basic procedures for boarding and inspection pursuant to Article 21
1. The inspecting State shall ensure that its duly authorised inspectors:
(a) present credentials to the master of the vessel and produce a copy of the text of the relevant conservation and management measures or rules and regulations in force in the high seas area in question, pursuant to those measures;
(b) initiate notice to the flag State at the time of the boarding and inspection;
(c) do not interfere with the master's ability to communicate with the authorities of the flag State during the boarding and inspection;
(d) provide a copy of a report on the boarding and inspection to the master and to the authorities of the flag State, noting therein any objection or statement which the master wishes to have included in the report;
(e) promptly leave the vessel following completion of the inspection if they find no evidence of a serious violation; and
2. The duly authorised inspectors of an inspecting State shall have the authority to inspect the vessel, its licence, gear, equipment, records, facilities, fish and fish products and any relevant documents necessary to verify compliance with the relevant conservation and management measures.
3. The flag State shall ensure that vessel masters:
(a) accept and facilitate prompt and safe boarding by the inspectors;
(b) cooperate with and assist in the inspection of the vessel conducted pursuant to these procedures;
(c) do not obstruct, intimidate or interfere with the inspectors in the performance of their duties;
(d) allow the inspectors to communicate with the authorities of the flag State and the inspecting State during the boarding and inspection;
(f) facilitate safe disembarkation by the inspectors.
4. In the event that the master of a vessel refuses to accept boarding and inspection in accordance with this Article and Article 21, the flag State shall, except in circumstances where, in accordance with generally accepted international regulations, procedures and practices relating to safety at sea, it is necessary to delay the boarding and inspection, direct the master of the vessel to submit immediately to boarding and inspection and, if the master does not comply with such direction, shall suspend the vessel's authorisation to fish and order the vessel to return immediately to port. The flag State shall advise the inspecting State of the action it has taken when the circumstances referred to in this paragraph arise.
Measures taken by a port State
1. A port State has the right and the duty to take measures, in accordance with international law, to promote the effectiveness of subregional, regional and global conservation and management measures. When taking such measures a port State shall not discriminate in form or in fact against the vessels of any State.
2. A port State may, inter alia, inspect documents, fishing gear and catch on board fishing vessels, when such vessels are voluntarily in its ports or at its offshore terminals.
3. States may adopt regulations empowering the relevant national authorities to prohibit landings and transhipments where it has been established that the catch has been taken in a manner which undermines the effectiveness of subregional, regional or global conservation and management measures on the high seas.
4. Nothing in this Article affects the exercise by States of their sovereignty over ports in their territory in accordance with international law.
REQUIREMENTS OF DEVELOPING STATES
Recognition of the special requirements of developing States
1. States shall give full recognition to the special requirements of developing States in relation to conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks and development of fisheries for such stocks. To this end, States shall, either directly or through the United Nations Development Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations and other specialised agencies, the Global Environment Facility, the Commission on Sustainable Development and other appropriate international and regional organisations and bodies, provide assistance to developing States.
2. In giving effect to the duty to cooperate in the establishment of conservation and management measures for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, States shall take into account the special requirements of developing States, in particular:
(a) the vulnerability of developing States which are dependent on the exploitation of living marine resources, including for meeting the nutritional requirements of their populations or parts thereof;
(c) the need to ensure that such measures do not result in transferring, directly or indirectly, a disproportionate burden of conservation action onto developing States.
Forms of cooperation with developing States
1. States shall cooperate, either directly or through subregional, regional or global organisations:
(a) to enhance the ability of developing States, in particular the least-developed among them and small island developing States, to conserve and manage straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks and to develop their own fisheries for such stocks;
(c) to facilitate the participation of developing States in subregional and regional fisheries management organisations and arrangements.
2. Cooperation with developing States for the purposes set out in this Article shall include the provision of financial assistance, assistance relating to human resources development, technical assistance, transfer of technology, including through joint-venture arrangements, and advisory and consultative services.
3. Such assistance shall, inter alia, be directed specifically towards:
(a) improved conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks through collection, reporting, verification, exchange and analysis of fisheries data and related information;
(b) stock assessment and scientific research;
Special assistance in the implementation of this Agreement
1. States shall cooperate to establish special funds to assist developing States in the implementation of this Agreement, including assisting developing States to meet the costs involved in any proceedings for the settlement of disputes to which they may be parties.
2. States and international organisations should assist developing States in establishing new subregional or regional fisheries management organisations or arrangements, or in strengthening existing organisations or arrangements, for the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.
PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES
Obligation to settle disputes by peaceful means
States have the obligation to settle their disputes by negotiation, inquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice.
States shall cooperate in order to prevent disputes. To this end, States shall agree on efficient and expeditious decision-making procedures within subregional and regional fisheries management organisations and arrangements and shall strengthen existing decision-making procedures as necessary.
Disputes of a technical nature
Where a dispute concerns a matter of a technical nature, the States concerned may refer the dispute to an ad hoc expert panel established by them. The panel shall confer with the States concerned and shall endeavour to resolve the dispute expeditiously without recourse to binding procedures for the settlement of disputes.
Procedures for the settlement of disputes
1. The provisions relating to the settlement of disputes set out in Part XV of the Convention apply mutatis mutandis to any dispute between States Parties to this Agreement concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement, whether or not they are also Parties to the Convention.
2. The provisions relating to the settlement of disputes set out in Part XV of the Convention apply mutatis mutandis to any dispute between States Parties to this Agreement concerning the interpretation or application of a subregional, regional or global fisheries agreement relating to straddling fish stocks or highly migratory fish stocks to which they are parties, including any dispute concerning the conservation and management of such stocks, whether or not they are also Parties to the Convention.
3.

PROTOCOL TO THE 1979 CONVENTION ON LONG-RANGE TRANSBOUNDARY AIR POLLUTION ON FURTHER REDUCTION OF SULPHUR EMISSIONS
CONCERNED that emissions of sulphur and other air pollutants continue to be transported across international boundaries and, in exposed parts of Europe and North America, are causing widespread damage to natural resources of vital environmental and economic importance, such as forests, soils and waters, and to materials, including historic monuments, and, under certain circumstances, have harmful effects on human health,
RESOLVED to take precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent or minimise emissions of air pollutants and mitigate their adverse effects,
CONVINCED that where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing such measures, taking into account that such precautionary measures to deal with emissions of air pollutants should be cost-effective,
MINDFUL that measures to control emissions of sulphur and other air pollutants would also contribute to the protection of the sensitive Arctic environment,
CONSIDERING that the predominant sources of air pollution contributing to the acidification of the environment are the combustion of fossil fuels for energy production, and the main technological processes in various industrial sectors, as well as transport, which lead to emissions of sulphur, nitrogen oxides, and other pollutants,
CONSCIOUS of the need for a cost-effective regional approach to combating air pollution that takes account of the variations in effects and abatement costs between countries,
DESIRING to take further and more effective action to control and reduce sulphur emissions,
COGNISANT that any sulphur control policy, however cost-effective it may be at the regional level, will result in a relatively heavy economic burden on countries with economies that are in transition to a market economy,
BEARING IN MIND that measures taken to reduce sulphur emissions should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international competition and trade,
TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION existing scientific and technical data on emissions, atmospheric processes and effects on the environment of sulphur oxides, as well as on abatement costs,
AWARE that, in addition to emissions of sulphur, emissions of nitrogen oxides and of ammonia are also causing acidification of the environment,
NOTING that under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, adopted in New York on 9 May 1992, there is agreement to establish national policies and take corresponding measures to combat climate change, which can be expected to lead to reductions of sulphur emissions,
AFFIRMING the need to ensure environmentally sound and sustainable development,
RECOGNISING the need to continue scientific and technical cooperation to elaborate further the approach based on critical loads and critical levels, including efforts to assess several air pollutants and various effects on the environment, materials and human health,
UNDERLINING that scientific and technical knowledge is developing and that it will be necessary to take such developments into account when reviewing the adequacy of the obligations entered into under the present Protocol and deciding on further action,
ACKNOWLEDGING the Protocol on the Reduction of Sulphur Emissions or Their Transboundary Fluxes by at least 30 per cent, adopted in Helsinki on 8 July 1985, and the measures already taken by many countries which have had the effect of reducing sulphur emissions,

Article 2 Basic obligations
1. The Parties shall control and reduce their sulphur emissions in order to protect human health and the environment from adverse effects, in particular acidifying effects, and to ensure, as far as possible, without entailing excessive costs, that depositions of oxidised sulphur compounds in the long term do not exceed critical loads for sulphur given, in Annex I, as critical sulphur depositions, in accordance with present scientific knowledge.
2. As a first step, the Parties shall, as a minimum, reduce and maintain their annual sulphur emissions in accordance with the timing and levels specified in Annex II.
3. In addition, any Party:
(a) whose total land area is greater than 2 million square kilometres;
(b) which has committed itself under paragraph 2 above to a national sulphur emission ceiling no greater than the lesser of its 1990 emissions or its obligation in the 1985 Helsinki Protocol on the reduction of sulphur emissions or their transboundary fluxes by at least 30 %, as indicated in Annex II;
(c) whose annual sulphur emissions that contribute to acidification in areas under the jurisdiction of one or more other Parties originate only from within areas under its jurisdiction that are listed as SOMAs in Annex III, and has presented documentation to this effect; and
(d) which has specified upon signature of, or accession to, the present Protocol its intention to act in accordance with this paragraph,
shall, as a minimum, reduce and maintain its annual sulphur emissions in the area so listed in accordance with the timing and levels specified in Annex II.
4. Furthermore, the Parties shall make use of the most effective measures for the reduction of sulphur emissions, appropriate in their particular circumstances, for new and existing sources, which include, inter alia:
- measures to increase energy efficiency,
- measures to increase the use of renewable energy,
- measures to reduce the sulphur content of particular fuels and to encourage the use of fuel with a low sulphur content, including the combined use of high-sulphur with low-sulphur or sulphur-free fuel,
- measures to apply best available control technologies not entailing excessive cost,
using the guidance in Annex IV.
5. Each Party, except those Parties subject to the United States/Canada Air Quality Agreement of 1991, shall as a minimum:
(a) apply emission limit values at least as stringent as those specified in Annex V to all major new stationary combustion sources;
(b) no later than 1 July 2004 apply, as far as possible without entailing excessive costs, emission limit values at least as stringent as those specified in Annex V to those major existing stationary combustion sources the thermal input of which is above 500 MWth taking into account the remaining lifetime of a plant, calculated from the date of entry into force of the present Protocol, or apply equivalent emission limitations or other appropriate provisions, provided that these achieve the sulphur emission ceilings specified in Annex II and, subsequently, further approach the critical loads as given in Annex I; and no later than 1 July 2004 apply emission limit values or emission limitations to those major existing stationary combustion sources the thermal input of which is between 50 and 500 MWth using Annex V as guidance;
(c) no later than two years after the date of entry into force of the present Protocol apply national standards for the sulphur content of gas oil at least as stringent as those specified in Annex V. In cases where the supply of gas oil cannot otherwise be ensured, a State may extend the time period given in this subparagraph to a period of up to 10 years. In this case it shall specify, in a declaration to be deposited together with the instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, its intention to extend the time period.

between the European Communities and the Government of Canada regarding the application of their competition laws
THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY AND THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY (the European Communities) of the one part and THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA (Canada) of the other part (the Parties):
Considering the close economic relations between them;
Recognising that the world's economies, including those of the parties, are becoming increasingly interrelated;
Noting that the parties share the view that the sound and effective enforcement of competition law is a matter of importance to the efficient operation of their respective markets and to trade between them;
Acknowledging their commitment to enhancing the sound and effective enforcement of their competition laws through cooperation and, in appropriate cases, coordination between them in the application of those laws;
Noting that coordination of their enforcement activities may, in certain cases, result in a more effective resolution of the Parties' respective competition concerns than would be attained through independent enforcement action by the Parties;
Acknowledging the Parties' commitment to giving careful consideration to each other's important interests in the application of their competition laws and to using their best efforts to arrive at an accommodation of those interests;
Having regard to the Recommendation of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Concerning Cooperation Between Member Countries on Restrictive Business Practices Affecting International Trade, adopted on 27 and 28 July 1995, and
HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:
I. Purpose and definitions
1. The purpose of this Agreement is to promote cooperation and coordination between the competition authorities of the Parties and to lessen the possibility or impact of differences between the Parties in the application of their competition laws.
2. In this Agreement,
"anti-competitive activities" shall mean any conduct or transaction that may be subject to penalties or other relief under the competition laws of a Party;
"competent authority of a Member State" shall mean that authority of a Member State set out in Annex A. Annex A may be added to or modified at any time by the European Communities. Canada will be notified in writing of such additions or modifications before any information is sent to a newly listed authority;
"competition authority" and "competition authorities" shall mean:
(i) for Canada, the Commissioner of Competition appointed under the Competition Act, and
(ii) for the European Communities, the Commission of the European Communities, as to its responsibilities pursuant to the competition laws of the European Communities;
"competition law or laws" shall mean:
(i) for Canada, the Competition Act and regulations thereunder, and
(ii) for the European Communities, Articles 85, 86, and 89 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 on the control of concentrations between undertakings, Articles 65 and 66 of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), and their implementing Regulations pursuant to the said Treaties including High Authority Decision No 2454,
as well as any amendments thereto and such other laws or regulations as the parties may jointly agree in writing to be a "competition law" for the purposes of this Agreement,
"enforcement activity" shall mean any application of competition law by way of investigation or proceeding conducted by the competition authority of a Party.
3. Any reference in this Agreement to a specific provision in either Party's competition law shall be interpreted as referring to that provision as amended from time to time and to any successive provisions.
1. Each Party shall notify the other Party in the manner provided by this Article and Article IX with respect to its enforcement activities that may affect important interests of the other Party.
2. Enforcement activities that may affect the important interests of the other Party and therefore ordinarily give rise to notifiable circumstances include those:
(i) that are relevant to enforcement activities of the other Party;
(ii) that involve anticompetitive activities, other than mergers or acquisitions, carried out wholly or in part in the territory of the other Party;
(iii) that involve conduct believed to have been required, encouraged or approved by the other Party or one of its provinces or Member States;
(iv) that involve a merger or acquisition in which:
- a company controlling one or more of the parties to the transaction,
is a company incorporated or organised under the laws of the other Party or one of its provinces or Member States,
(v) that involve the imposition of, or application for, remedies by a competition authority that would require or prohibit conduct in the territory of the other Party, or
(vi) that involve one of the Parties seeking information located in the territory of the other Party.
3. Notification pursuant to this Article shall ordinarily be given as soon as a competition authority becomes aware that notifiable circumstances are present, and in any event, in accordance with paragraphs 4 through 7 of this Article.
4. Where notifiable circumstances are present with respect to mergers or acquisitions, notification shall be given:
(b) in the case of Canada, not later than when its competition authority issues a written request for information under oath or affirmation, or obtains an order under section 11 of the Competition Act, with respect to the transaction.
5. (a) When the competition authority of a Party requests that a person provide information, documents or other records located in the territory of the other Party, or requests oral testimony in a proceeding or participation in a personal interview by a person located in the territory of the other Party, notification shall be given at or before the time that the request is made.
(b) Notification pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this paragraph is required notwithstanding that the enforcement activity in relation to which the said information is sought has previously been notified pursuant to Article II, paragraphs 1 to 3. However, separate notification is not required for each subsequent request for information from the same person made in the course of such enforcement activity unless the notified Party indicates otherwise or unless the Party seeking information becomes aware of new issues bearing upon the important interests of the notified Party.
6. Where notifiable circumstances are present, notification shall also be given far enough in advance of each of the following events to enable the other Party's views to be considered:
(a) in the case of the European Communities,
(i) when its competition authority decides to initiate proceedings with respect to the concentration, pursuant to Article 6(1)(c) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89;
(iii) the adoption of a decision or settlement,
(b) in the case of Canada,
(i) the filing of an application with the Competition Tribunal,
(ii) the initiation of criminal proceedings,
7. (a) Each Party shall also notify the other whenever its competition authority intervenes or otherwise participates in a regulatory or judicial proceeding, if the issues addressed in the intervention or participation may affect the other Party's important interests. Notification under this paragraph shall apply only to:
(i) regulatory or judicial proceedings that are public, and
(b) Notification shall be made at the time of the intervention or participation or as soon thereafter as possible.
8. Notifications shall be sufficiently detailed to enable the notified Party to make an initial evaluation of the effects of the enforcement activity on its own important interests. Notifications shall include the names and addresses of the natural and legal persons involved, the nature of the activities under investigation and the legal provisions concerned.
9. Notifications made pursuant to this Article shall be communicated in accordance with Article IX.
1. Either Party may request consultations regarding any matter relating to this Agreement. The request for consultations shall indicate the reasons for the request and whether any procedural time limits or other constraints require that consultations be expedited. Each Party undertakes to consult promptly when so requested with the view to reaching a conclusion that is consistent with the principles set forth in this Agreement.
2. During consultations under paragraph 1, the competition authority of each Party shall carefully consider the representations of the other Party in light of the principles set out in this Agreement and shall be prepared to explain to the other Party the specific results of its application of those principles to the matter under discussion.
IV. Coordination of enforcement activities
1. The competition authority of each Party shall render assistance to the competition authority of the other Party in its enforcement activities to the extent compatible with the assisting Party's laws and important interests.
2. In cases where both Parties' competition authorities have an interest in pursuing enforcement activities with regard to related situations, they may agree that it is in their mutual interest to coordinate their enforcement activities. In considering whether particular enforcement activities should be coordinated, either in whole or in part, each Party's competition authority shall take into account the following factors, among others:
(i) the effect of such coordination on the ability of each Party's competition authority to achieve the objectives of its enforcement activities;
(ii) the relative ability of each Party's competition authority to obtain information necessary to conduct the enforcement activities;
(iii) the extent to which either Party's competition authority can secure effective preliminary or permanent relief against the anticompetitive activities involved;
(iv) the opportunity to make more efficient use of resources, and
3. (a) The Parties competition authorities may coordinate their enforcement activities by agreeing on the timing of those activities in a particular matter, while respecting fully their own laws and important interests. Such coordination may, as agreed by the Parties' competition authorities, result in enforcement action by one or both Parties' competition authorities, as is best suited to attain their objectives.
(b) When carrying out coordinated enforcement activity, each Party's competition authority shall seek to maximise the likelihood that the other Party's enforcement objectives will also be achieved.
(c) Either Party may at any time notify the other Party that it intends to limit or terminate the coordination and pursue its enforcement activities independently and subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.
V. Cooperation regarding anticompetitive activities in the territory of one Party that adversely affect the interests of the other Party
1. The Parties note that anticompetitive activities may occur within the territory of one Party that, in addition to violating that Party's competition laws, adversely affect important interests of the other Party. The Parties agree that it is in both their interests to address anticompetitive activities of this nature.
2. If a Party has reason to believe that anticompetitive activities carried out in the territory of the other Party are adversely affecting, or may adversely affect the first Party's important interests, the first Party may request that the other Party's competition authority initiate appropriate enforcement activities. The request shall be as specific as possible about the nature of the anticompetitive activities and their effects on the interests of the requesting Party, and shall include an offer of such further information and other cooperation as the requesting Party's competition authority is able to provide.
3. The requested Party shall consult with the requesting Party and the requested Party's competition authority shall accord full and sympathetic consideration to the request in deciding whether or not to initiate, or expand, enforcement activities with respect to the anticompetitive activities identified in the request. The requested Party's competition authority shall promptly inform the other Party of its decision and the reasons for that decision. If enforcement activities are initiated, the requested Party's competition authority shall advise the requesting Party of significant developments and the outcome of the enforcement activities.
4. Nothing in this Article limits the discretion of the requested Party's competition authority under its competition laws and enforcement policies as to whether or not to undertake enforcement activities with respect to the anticompetitive activities identified in the request, or precludes the requesting Party's competition authority from undertaking enforcement activities with respect to such anticompetitive activities.
VI. Avoidance of conflict
1. Within the framework of its own laws and to the extent compatible with its important interests, each Party shall, having regard to the purpose of this Agreement as set out in Article I, give careful consideration to the other Party's important interests throughout all phases of competition enforcement activities, including decisions regarding the initiation of an investigation or proceeding, the scope of an investigation or proceeding and the nature of the remedies or penalties sought in each case.
2. Where it appears that one Party's enforcement activities may adversely affect the important interests of the other Party, each Party shall, consistent with the general principles set out above, use its best efforts to arrive at an appropriate accommodation of the Parties competing interests and in doing so each Party shall consider all relevant factors, including:
(i) the relative significance to the anticompetitive activities involved of conduct occurring within one Party's territory as compared to conduct occurring within that of the other;
(ii) the relative significance and foreseeability of the effects of the anticompetitive activities on one Party's important interests as compared to the effects on the other Party's important interests;
(iii) the presence or absence of a purpose on the part of those engaged in the anticompetitive activities to affect consumers, suppliers or competitors within the enforcing Party's territory;
(iv) the degree of conflict or consistency between the enforcement activities and the other Party's laws or articulated economic policies including those expressed in the application of, or decisions under, their respective competition laws;
(v) whether private persons, either natural or legal, will be placed under conflicting requirements by both Parties;
(vi) the existence or absence of reasonable expectations that would be furthered or defeated by the enforcement activities;
(vii) the location of relevant assets;
(viii) the degree to which a remedy, in order to be effective, must be carried out within the other Party's territory;
(x) the extent to which enforcement activities of the other Party with respect to the same persons, including judgments or undertakings resulting from such activities, would be affected.
1. In furtherance of the principles set forth in this Agreement, the Parties agree that it is in their common interest to share information which will facilitate the effective application of their respective competition laws and promote better understanding of each others enforcement policies and activities.
2. Each Party agrees to provide to the other Party on request such information within its possession as the requesting Party may describe that is relevant to an enforcement activity that is being contemplated or conducted by the requesting Party's competition authority.
3. In the case of concurrent action by the competition authorities of both Parties with a view to the application of their competition law, the competition authority of each Party shall, on request by the competition authority of the other Party, ascertain whether the natural or legal persons concerned will consent to the sharing of confidential information related thereto between the Parties competition authorities.
4. During consultations pursuant to Article III, each Party shall provide the other with as much information as it is able in order to facilitate the broadest possible discussion regarding the relevant aspects of a particular transaction.
1. In furtherance of their common interest in cooperation and coordination in relation to their enforcement activities, appropriate officials of the Parties' competition authorities shall meet twice a year, or otherwise as agreed between the competition authorities of the Parties, to: (a) exchange information on their current enforcement activities and priorities, (b) exchange information on economic sectors of common interest, (c) discuss policy changes which they are considering, and (d) discuss other matters of mutual interest relating to the application of competition laws.
2. A report on these semiannual meetings shall be made available to the Joint Cooperation Committee under the Framework Agreement for Commercial and Economic Cooperation between the European Communities and Canada.
IX. Communications under this Agreement
Communications under this Agreement, including notifications under Article II and requests under Articles III and V, may be carried out by direct oral, telephonic or fax communication between the competition authorities of the Parties. Notifications under Article II and requests under Articles III and V, however, shall be confirmed promptly in writing through normal diplomatic channels.
X. Confidentiality and use of information
1. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither Party is required to disclose information to the other Party where such disclosure is prohibited by the laws of the Party possessing the information or would be incompatible with that Party's important interests.
2. Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, each Party shall, to the fullest extent possible, maintain the confidentiality of any information communicated to it in confidence by the other Party under this Agreement. Each Party shall oppose, to the fullest extent possible, any application by a third party for disclosure of such information.
3. (a) The competition authority of the European Communities, after notice to the Canadian competition authority, will inform the competent authorities of the Member State or Member States whose important interests are affected of the notifications sent to it by the Canadian competition authority.
(b) The competition authority of the European Communities, after consultation with the Canadian competition authority, will inform the competent authorities of such Member State or Member States of any cooperation and coordination of enforcement activities. However, as regards such activities, the competition authority of the European Communities will respect the Canadian competition authority's request not to disclose the information which it provides when necessary to ensure confidentiality.
4. Before taking any action which may result in a legal obligation to make available to a third party information provided in confidence under this Agreement, the Parties competition authorities shall consult one another and give due consideration to their respective important interests.
5. Information received by a Party under this Agreement, apart from information received under Article II, shall only be used for the purpose of enforcing that Party's competition laws. Information received under Article II shall only be used for the purpose of this Agreement.
6. A Party may require that information furnished pursuant to this Agreement be used subject to the terms and conditions it may specify. The receiving Party shall not use such information in a manner contrary to such terms and conditions without the prior consent of the other Party.
Nothing in this Agreement shall require a Party to take any action that is inconsistent with its existing laws, or require any change in the laws of the Parties or of their respective provinces or Member States.
XII. Entry into force and termination
1. This Agreement shall enter into force on signature.
2. This Agreement shall remain in force until 60 days after the date on which either Party notifies the other Party in writing that it wishes to terminate the Agreement.

The Parties agree that this review will include, among other things, an analysis of actual or potential cases to determine whether their interests could be better served through closer cooperation. Attached to this Agreement are three letters exchanged between the Parties. These letters form an integral part of this Agreement.
concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latters' association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis
THE REPUBLIC OF ICELAND AND
THE KINGDOM OF NORWAY,
WHEREAS since the signature of the Agreement of Luxembourg of 19 December 1996 between the thirteen Member States of the European Union, signatories to the Schengen agreements and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway, the latter two States have been participating in the discussions concerning the application, implementation and further development of the Schengen agreements and related provisions;
WHEREAS as a result of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community by the Treaty of Amsterdam amending the Treaty on European Union, the Treaties establishing the European Communities and certain related Acts (hereinafter referred to as "the Schengen Protocol"), the cooperation among the Member States of the European Union signatories to the Schengen agreements within the scope of those agreements and related provisions will be conducted within the institutional and legal framework of the European Union and with respect for the relevant provisions of the Treaty on European Union and of the Treaty establishing the European Community;
RECALLING the object and purpose of the Agreement of Luxembourg to preserve the existing regime between the five Nordic States pursuant to the Convention on the Abolition of Passport Controls at Intra-Nordic borders signed in Copenhagen on 12 July 1957, establishing the Nordic Passport Union, once those of the Nordic States which are Members of the European Union take part in the regime on the abolition of checks on persons at internal borders set out in the Schengen agreements;
BEARING IN MIND the provisions laid down in the Agreement of Luxembourg;
RECOGNISING, however, that the integration of the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union implies that the taking of decisions purporting to further develop the provisions constituting the Schengen acquis has become a matter for the European Union, including the European Community;
WHEREAS according to Article 6, first paragraph, of the Schengen Protocol, the European Union, including the European Community, wishes to respect and serve the object and purpose of the Agreement of Luxembourg through an Agreement associating the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway, upon the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, with the implementation of the Schengen acquis and its further development on the basis of the Agreement of Luxembourg, thus ensuring the common objective of continuing the involvement of these two States in these activities;
CONVINCED of the need to involve all parties in an appropriate fashion which are applying the provisions constituting the Schengen acquis and to which such provisions and their further development may eventually have to apply, including the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway, in discussions, at all levels, concerning their practical application, their implementation and the preparation of their further development;
CONSIDERING that for this purpose it is necessary to set up an organisational structure, outside the institutional framework of the European Union, ensuring the association of the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway with the decision-making process in these fields and enabling their participation in these activities through a Mixed Committee,
HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

This Agreement creates reciprocal rights and obligations in accordance with the procedures set out herein.
1. The provisions of the Schengen acquis as listed in Annex A to this Agreement as they apply to the Member States of the European Union hereinafter referred to as the "Member States" which participate in the closer cooperation authorised by the Schengen Protocol, shall be implemented and applied by Iceland and Norway.

3. The acts and the measures taken by the European Union amending or building upon the provisions referred to in Annexes A and B, to which the procedures set out in this Agreement have been applied, shall also, without prejudice to Article 8, be accepted, implemented and applied by Iceland and Norway.

2. The Mixed Committee shall adopt its own Rules of Procedure by consensus.
3. The Mixed Committee shall meet at the initiative of its President or at the request of any of its members.
4. Subject to Article 4(2), the Mixed Committee meets at the level of Ministers, senior officials or experts, as circumstances require.
5. The office of President of the Mixed Committee shall be held:
- at the level of experts: by the representative of the European Union;
- at the level of senior officials and Ministers: alternately, for a period of six months by the representative of the European Union and by the representative of the government of Iceland or Norway.
1. The Mixed Committee shall address, in accordance with this Agreement, all matters covered by Article 2 and shall ensure that any concern entertained by Iceland and Norway is duly considered.
2. In the Mixed Committee at the ministerial level, the representatives of Iceland and Norway shall have the opportunity:
- to explain the problems they encounter in respect of a particular act or measure or to respond to the problems encountered by other delegations;
- to express themselves on any questions concerning the development of provisions of concern to them or the implementation thereof.
3. Meetings of the Mixed Committee at ministerial level shall be prepared by the Mixed Committee at the level of senior officials.
4. The representatives of the governments of Iceland and Norway shall have the right to make suggestions in the Mixed Committee relating to the matters mentioned in Article 1. After discussion, the Commission or any Member State may consider such suggestions with a view to making a proposal or taking an initiative, in accordance with the rules of the European Union, for the adoption of an act or measure of the European Community or the European Union.
Without prejudice to Article 4, the Mixed Committee shall be informed about the preparation within the Council of any acts or measures which may be relevant to this Agreement.
When drafting new legislation in a field which is covered by this Agreement, the Commission shall informally seek advice from experts of Iceland and Norway in the same way as it seeks advice from experts of the Member States for drawing up its proposals.
The Contracting Parties agree that an appropriate arrangement should be concluded on the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in any of the Member States or in Iceland or Norway. Such as arrangement should be in place at the time the provisions referred to in Annex A and Annex B, as well as those already adopted pursuant Article 2(3), are put into effect for Iceland and Norway in accordance with Article 15(4).
1. The adoption of new acts or measures related to matters reffered to in Article 2 shall be reserved to the competent institutions of the European Union. Subject to paragraph 2, such acts or measures shall enter into force simultaneously for the European Union and its Member States concerned and for Iceland and Norway, unless those acts or measures explicitly state otherwise. In this context, due account shall be taken of the time indicated by Iceland or Norway in the Mixed Committee as the time necessary to enable Iceland or Norway to fulfil their constitutional requirements.
2. (a) The adoption of the acts or measures referred to in paragraph 1 to which the procedures set out in this Agreement have been applied, shall be notified immediately by the Council to Iceland and Norway. Iceland and Norway shall decide independently whether to accept their content and to implement it into their internal legal order. These decisions shall be notified to the Council and to the Commission within thirty days of the adoption of the acts or measures concerned.
(b) If the content of such an act or measure can become binding on Iceland only after the fulfilment of constitutional requirements, Iceland shall inform the Council and the Commission of this at the time of its notification. Iceland shall promptly inform the Council and the Commission in writing upon fulfilment of all constitutional requirements, and shall provide such information no later than four weeks before the date laid down for the entry into force of the act or measure for Iceland, as decided according to paragraph 1.
(c) If the content of such an act or measure can become binding on Norway only after the fulfilment of constitutional requirements, Norway shall inform the Council and the Commission of this at the time of its notification. Norway shall promptly, and at the latest six months from notification by the Council, inform the Council and the Commission in writing upon fulfilment of all constitutional requirements. From the date laid down for the entry into force of the act or measure for Norway and until the information upon fulfilment of constitutional requirements, Norway shall provisionally apply, where possible, the content of such act or measure.
3. The acceptance by Iceland and Norway of the content of acts and measures referred to in paragraph 2 shall create rights and obligations between Iceland and Norway, and between Iceland and Norway on the one hand, and the European Community and those of its Member States bound by those acts and measures, on the other hand.
(a) either Iceland or Norway notifies its decision not to accept the content of an act or measure referred to in paragraph 2 and to which the procedures set out in this Agreement have been applied; or
(b) either Iceland or Norway does not make a notification within the thirty days time limit set out in paragraph 2(a); or

(d) Norway does not make a notification within the six month time limit set out in paragraph 2(c) or does not provide for provisional application as envisaged in the same subparagraph from the date laid down for the entry into force of the act of measure concerned for it;
this Agreement shall be considered terminated with respect to Iceland or Norway, as the case may be, unless the Mixed Committee, after a careful examination of ways to continue the Agreement, decides otherwise within ninety days. Termination of this Agreement shall take effect three months after the expiry of the ninety days period.
1. In order to achieve the objective of the Contracting Parties to arrive at as uniform an application and interpretation as possible of the provisions referred to in Article 2, the Mixed Committee shall keep under constant review the development of the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, hereinafter referred to as the "Court of Justice", as well as the development of the case law of the competent courts of Iceland and Norway relating to such provisions. To this end a mechanism shall be set up to ensure regular mutual transmission of such case law.
2. Subject to the adoption of the necessary modifications to the Statute of the Court of Justice, Iceland and Norway shall be entitled to submit statements of case or written observations to the Court of Justice in cases where a question has been referred to it by a court or tribunal of a Member State for a preliminary ruling concerning the interpretation of any provision referred to in Article 2.
1. Iceland and Norway shall submit reports annually to the Mixed Committee on the way in which their administrative authorities and their courts have applied and interpreted the provisions referred to in Article 2, as interpreted by the Court of Justice, as the case may be.
2. If the Mixed Committee, within two months after a substantial difference in the case law of the Court of Justice and the courts of Iceland or Norway or a substancial difference in application between the authorities of the Member States concerned and those of Iceland or Norway in respect of the provisions referred to in Article 2 has been brought before it, has not been able to ensure the preservation of a uniform application and interpretation, the procedure in article 11 shall apply.
1. In the case of a dispute about the application of this Agreement or in a case where the situation provided for in Article 10(2) occurs, the matter shall be officially entered as a matter of dispute on the agenda of the Mixed Committee at ministerial level.
2. The Mixed Committee shall have ninety days from the date of the adoption of the agenda on which the dispute has been entered within which to settle the dispute.
3. In a case where the dispute cannot be settled by the Mixed Committee within the period of ninety days envisaged in paragraph 2, a further period of thirty days shall be observed for reaching a final settlement.
If no final settlement is reached, this Agreement shall be considered as terminated with respect to Iceland or Norway, depending on which State the dispute concerns. Such termination shall take effect six months after the expiry of the thirty day period.
1. As far as administrative costs involved in the application of this Agreement are concerned, Iceland and Norway shall contribute to the general budget of the European Communities an annual sum of:
- for Iceland 0,1 %
- for Norway 4,995 %
of an amount of 300000000 BEF (or an equivalent amount in euro) subject to annual adjustment in view of the rate of inflation within the European Union.
In cases where operational costs involved in the application of this Agreement are not attributed to the general budget of the European Communities, but are directly incumbent upon the participating Member States, Iceland and Norway shall contribute to these costs in accordance with the percentage of the gross national product of their countries in relation to the gross national product of all participating States.
In cases where operational costs are attributed to the general budget of the European Community, Iceland and Norway shall share in these costs by contributing to the said budget an annual sum in accordance with the percentage of the gross national product of their countries in relation with the gross national product of all participating States.
2. Iceland and Norway shall have the right to receive documents drawn up by the Commission or within the Council pertaining to this Agreement and, at meetings of the Mixed Commitee, to request interpretation into an official language of the institutions of the European Communities of their choice. However, any costs of translation or interpretation into or form Icelandic or Nowegian shall be borne by Iceland or Norway, as the case may be.
1. This Agreement shall not affect in any way the Agreement on the European Economic Area or any other agreement concluded between the European Community and Iceland and/or Norway.

4. The provisions referred to in Annex A und Annex B, as well as those already adopted pursuant to Article 2(3), shall be put into effect for Iceland and Norway on a date to be fixed by the Council acting by unanimity of its Members representing the Member States which participate in the closer cooperation authorised by the Schengen Protocol, after consultations in the Mixed Committee in accordance with Article 4 of this Agreement, having satisfied itself that the preconditions for the implementation of the relevant provisions have been fulfilled by Iceland and Norway and that controls at their external borders are effective.
5. The putting into effect of the provisions referred to in paragraph 4 shall create rights and obligations between Iceland and Norway, and between Iceland and Norway on the one hand, and the European Community and those of its Member States in respect of which those provisions have also been put into effect, on the other hand.
This Agreement may be denounced by Iceland or by Norway or by decision of the Council, acting by the unanimity of its members representing the Member States which participate in the closer cooperation authorised by the Schengen Protocol. Such denunciation shall be notified to the depositary. It shall take effect six months after notification.
The consequences of denunciation of this Agreement by, or its termination with respect to, Iceland or Norway shall be the subject of an agreement between the remaining Parties and the Party which has denounced this Agreement or with respect to which the termination is to take effect.

AGREEMENT IN THE FORM OF EXCHANGES OF LETTERS
between the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning committees which assist the European Commission in the exercise of its executive powers
A. Letter from the Community
The Council refers to the negotiations concerning the Agreement concerning the association of the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway to the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis and has taken good note of the request of Iceland and Norway, in the spirit of their participation in the decision-making process in the fields covered by the Agreement and in order to enhance the good functioning of the Agreement, to be fully associated with the work of the committees which assist the European Commission in the exercise of its executive powers.
The Council notes that in future, when such procedures will be applied in the fields covered by the Agreement, there will indeed be a need to associate Iceland and Norway with the work of these committees, also in order to ensure that the procedures of the Agreement have been applied to the acts or measures concerned, so that these may become binding on Iceland and Norway.
Therefore, the European Community is ready to commit itself to negotiate, as soon as the need arises, appropriate arrangements for the association of Iceland and Norway with the work of these committees.
I should be obliged if you would inform me of whether or not your Government is in agreement with the above.
Please accept, Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration.
EUROPEAN CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF VERTEBRATE ANIMALS USED FOR EXPERIMENTAL AND OTHER SCIENTIFIC PURPOSES
THE MEMBER STATES OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE, SIGNATORY HERETO,
Recalling that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity between its members and that it wishes to cooperate with other States in the protection of live animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes;
Recognising that man has a moral obligation to respect all animals and to have due consideration for their capacity for suffering and memory;
Accepting nevertheless that man in his quest for knowledge, health and safety has a need to use animals where there is a reasonable expectation that the result will be to extend knowledge or be to the overall benefit of man or animal, just as he uses them for food, clothing and as beasts of burden;
Resolved to limit the use of animals for experimental and other scientific purposes, with the aim of replacing such use wherever practical, in particular by seeking alternative measures and encouraging the use of these alternative measures;
Desirous to adopt common provisions in order to protect animals used in those procedures which may possibly cause pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm and to ensure that where unavoidable they shall be kept to a minimum,
HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:
1. This Convention applies to any animal used or intended for use in any experimental or other scientific procedure where that procedure may cause pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm. It does not apply to any non-experimental agricultural or clinical veterinary practice.
2. In this Convention:
(a) "animal", unless otherwise qualified, means any live non-human vertebrate including free-living and/or reproducing larval forms, but excluding other foetal or embryonic forms;
(b) "intended for use" means bred or kept for the purpose of sale, disposal or use in any experimental or other scientific procedure;
(c) "procedure" means any experimental or other scientific use of an animal which may cause it pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm, including any course of action intended to, or liable to, result in the birth of an animal in any such conditions, but excluding the least painful methods accepted in modern practice (that is "humane" methods) of killing or marking an animal. A procedure starts when an animal is first prepared for use and ends when no further observations are to be made for that procedure; the elimination of pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm by the successful use of anaesthesia or analgesia or other methods does not place the use of an animal outside the scope of this definition;
(d) "competent person" means any person who is considered by a Party to be competent in its territory to perform the relevant function described in this Convention;
(e) "responsible authority" means, in the territory of a given Party, any authority, body or person designated for the relevant purpose;
(f) "establishment" means any stable or mobile facility, any building, group of buildings or other premises, including a place which is not wholly enclosed or covered;
(g) "breeding establishment" means any establishment where animals are bred with a view to their use in procedures;
(h) "supplying establishment" means any establishment, other than a breeding establishment, from which animals are supplied with a view to their use in procedures;
(i) "user establishment" means any establishment where animals are used in procedures;
(j) "humane method of killing" means the killing of an animal with a minimum of physical and mental suffering appropriate to the species.
A procedure may be performed for one or more of the following purposes only and subject to the restrictions laid down in this Convention:
(a) (i) avoidance or prevention of disease, ill-health or other abnormality, or their effects, in man, vertebrate or invertebrate animals or plants, including the production and the quality, efficacy and safety testing of drugs, substances or products;
(ii) diagnosis or treatment of disease, ill-health or other abnormality, or their effects, in man, vertebrate or invertebrate animals or plants;
(b) detection, assessment, regulation or modification of physiological conditions in man, vertebrate and invertebrate animals or plants;
(c) protection of the environment;
(e) education and training;
Each Party undertakes to take all the necessary steps to give effect to the provisions of this Convention and to ensure an effective system of control and supervision as soon as possible and in any case within a period of five years from the date of entry into force of the present Convention in respect of that Party.
No provision in this Convention shall affect the liberty of the Parties to adopt stricter measures for the protection of animals used in procedures or for the control and restriction of the use of animals in procedures.
General care and accommodation
1. Any animal used or intended for use in a procedure shall be provided with accommodation, an environment, at least a minimum degree of freedom of movement, food, water and care, appropriate to its health and well-being. Any restriction on the extent to which an animal can satisfy its physiological and ethological needs shall be limited as far as practicable. In the implementation of this provision, regard should be paid to the guidelines for accommodation and care of animals set out in Appendix A to this Convention.
2. The environmental conditions in which animals are bred, kept or used shall be checked daily.
3. The well-being and state of health of animals shall be observed sufficiently closely and frequently to prevent pain or avoidable suffering, distress or lasting harm.
4. Each Party shall determine arrangements to ensure that any defect or suffering discovered is corrected as quickly as possible.
1. A procedure shall not be performed for any of the purposes referred to in Article 2, if another scientifically satisfactory method, not entailing the use of an animal, is reasonably and practicably available.
2. Each Party should encourage scientific research into the development of methods which could provide the same information as that obtained in procedures.
When a procedure has to be performed, the choice of species shall be carefully considered and, where required, be explained to the responsible authority; in a choice between procedures, those should be selected which use the minimum number of animals, cause the least pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm and which are most likely to provide satisfactory results.
A procedure shall be performed under general or local anaesthesia or analgesia or by other methods designed to eliminate as far as practicable pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm, applied throughout the procedure unless:
(b) the use of anaesthesia or analgesia is compatible with the aim of the procedure. In such cases, appropriate legislative and/or administrative measures shall be taken to ensure that no such procedure is carried out unnecessarily.
1. Where it is planned to subject an animal to a procedure in which it will or may experience severe pain which is likely to endure, that procedure must be specifically declared and justified to, or specifically authorised by, the responsible authority.
2. Appropriate legislative and/or administrative measures shall be taken to ensure that no such procedure is carried out unnecessarily.
Such measures shall include:
- either specific authorisation by the responsible authority,
- or specific declaration of such procedure to the responsible authority and judicial or administrative action by that authority if it is not satisfied that the procedure is of sufficient importance for meeting the essential needs of man or animal, including the solution of scientific problems.
During a procedure, an animal used shall remain subject to the provisions of Article 5 except where those provisions are incompatible with the objective of the procedure.
1. At the end of a procedure it shall be decided whether the animal shall be kept alive or killed by a humane method. An animal shall not be kept alive if, even though it has been restored to normal health in all other respects, it is likely to remain in lasting pain or distress.
2. The decisions referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be taken by a competent person, in particular a veterinarian, or the person who, in accordance with Article 13, is responsible for, or has performed, the procedure.
3. Where, at the end of a procedure:
(a) an animal is to be kept alive, it shall receive the care appropriate to its state of health, be placed under the supervision of a veterinarian or other competent person and kept under conditions conforming to the requirements of Article 5. The conditions laid down in this subparagraph may, however, be waived where, in the opinion of a veterinarian, the animal would not suffer as a consequence of such exemption;
(b) an animal is not to be kept alive or cannot benefit from the provisions of Article 5 for its well-being, it shall be killed by a humane method as soon as possible.
4. No animal which has been used in a procedure entailing severe or enduring pain or suffering, irrespective of whether anaesthesia or analgesia was employed, shall be used in a further procedure unless it has returned to good health and well-being, and either:
(b) the further procedure will involve minor interventions only.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Convention, where it is necessary for the legitimate purposes of the procedure, the responsible authority may allow the animal concerned to be set free provided that it is satisfied that the maximum practicable care has been taken to safeguard the animal's well-being. Procedures that involve setting the animal free shall not be permitted solely for educational or training purposes.
A procedure for the purposes referred to in Article 2 may be carried out only by persons authorised, or under the direct responsibility of a person authorised, or if the experimental or other scientific project concerned is authorised in accordance with the provisions of national legislation. Authorisation shall be granted only to persons deemed to be competent by the responsible authority.
Breeding or supplying establishments
Breeding and supplying establishments shall be registered with the responsible authority subject to the grant of an exemption under Article 21 or Article 22. Such registered establishments shall comply with the requirements of Article 5.
The registration provided for in Article 14 shall specify the person in charge of the establishment, who shall be competent to administer or arrange for suitable care for animals of the species bred or kept in the establishment.
1. Arrangements shall be made at registered breeding establishments to record, in respect of the animals bred there, the number and species of such animals leaving, the dates they leave and the name and address of the recipient.
2. Arrangements shall be made at registered supplying establishments to record the number and species of such animals entering and leaving, the dates of these movements, from whom the animals concerned were acquired and the name and address of the recipient.
3. The responsible authority shall prescribe the records which are to be kept and made available to it by the person in charge of the establishments mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article; such records shall be kept for a minimum of three years from the date of the last entry.
1. Each dog and cat in an establishment shall be individually and permanently marked in the least painful manner possible before it is weaned.
2. Where an unmarked dog or cat is taken into an establishment for the first time after is has been weaned, it shall be marked as soon as possible.
3. Where a dog or cat is transferred from one establishment to another before it is weaned and it is not practical to mark it beforehand, a full documentary record, specifying in particular its mother, shall be kept until it can be marked.
4. Particulars of the identity and origin of each dog or cat shall be entered in the records of the establishment.
User establishments shall be registered with or otherwise approved by the responsible authority and shall comply with the conditions laid down in Article 5.
Provisions shall be made at user establishments for installations and equipment appropriate for the species of animals used and the performance of the procedures conducted there. The design, construction and functioning of such installations and equipment shall be such as to ensure that the procedures are performed as effectively as possible, with the object of obtaining consistent results with the minimum number of animals and the minimum degree of pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm.
(a) the person or persons who are administratively responsible for the care of the animals and the functioning of the equipment shall be identified;
(b) sufficient trained stuff shall be provided;
(c) adequate arrangements shall be made for the provision of veterinary advice and treatment;
(d) a veterinarian or other competent person should be charged with advisory duties in relation to the well-being of the animals.
1. Animals of the species listed below which are for use in procedures shall be acquired directly from or originate from registered breeding establishments, unless a general or special exemption has been obtained under arrangements to be determined by the Party:
golden hamster: mesocricerus auratus
2. Each Party undertakes to extend the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article to other species, in particular of the order of primates, as soon as there is a reasonable prospect of a sufficient supply of purpose-bred animals of the species concerned.
3. Straying animals of a domesticated species shall not be used in procedures. A general exemption made under the conditions of paragraph 1 of this Article may not extend to stray dogs and cats.
In user establishments, only animals supplied from registered breeding or supplying establishments shall be used, unless a general or special exemption has been obtained under arrangements to be determined by the Party.
Procedures may, where authorised by the responsible authority, be conducted outside user establishments.
Arrangements shall be made at user establishments to maintain records and make them available as required by the responsible authority. In particular, these records shall be sufficient to meet the requirements of Article 27 and, in addition, show the number and species of all animals acquired, from whom they were acquired and their date of arrival.
1. Procedures carried out for the purpose of education, training or further training for professions or other occupations, including the care of animals being used or intended for use in procedures, must be notified to the responsible authority and shall be carried out by or under the supervision of a competent person, who will be responsible for ensuring that the procedures comply with national legislation under the terms of this Convention.
2. Procedures within the scope of education, training, or further training for purposes other than those referred to in paragraph 1 above shall not be permitted.
3. Procedures referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be restricted to those absolutely necessary for the purpose of the education or training concerned and be permitted only if their objective cannot be achieved by comparably effective audio-visual or any other suitable methods.
Persons who carry out procedures, or take part in procedures, or take care of animals used in procedures, including supervision, shall have had appropriate education and training.
1. Each Party shall collect statistical information on the use of animals in procedures and this information shall where lawful be made available to the public.
2. Information shall be collected in respect of:
(a) the numbers and kinds of animals used in procedures;
(b) the numbers of animals in selected categories used in procedures directly concerned with medicine and in education and training;
(c) the numbers of animals in selected categories used in procedures for the protection of man and the environment;
(d) the numbers of animals in selected categories used in procedures required by law.
1. Subject to requirements of national legislation relating to secrecy and confidentiality, each Party shall communicate every year to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe information in respect of the items mentioned in paragraph 2 of Article 27, presented in the form set out in Appendix B to this Convention.
2. The Secretary-General of the Council of Europe shall publish the statistical information received from the Parties in respect of the items mentioned in paragraph 2 of Article 27.
3. Each Party is invited to communicate to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe the address of its national authority from which information about more comprehensive national statistics may be obtained on request. Such addresses will be contained in the publications of statistics made by the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.
Recognition of procedures carried out in the territory of another Party
1. In order to avoid unnecessary repetition of procedures required by law on health and safety, each Party shall, where practicable, recognise the results of procedures carried out in the territory of another Party.
2. To that end the Parties undertake, where practicable and lawful, to render each other mutual assistance, in particular by furnishing information on their legislation and administrative practice relating to the requirements for procedures to be carried out in support of submissions for registration of products, as well as factual information on procedures carried out in their territory and on authorisation or any other administrative particulars pertaining to these procedures.
The Parties shall, within five years from the entry into force of this Convention and every five years thereafter, or more frequently if a majority of the Parties should so request, hold multilateral consultations within the Council of Europe to examine the application of this Convention, and the advisability of revising it or extending any of its provisions.

AGREEMENT IN THE FORM OF AN EXCHANGE OF LETTERS
between the European Community and Ukraine amending the agreement between the European Community and Ukraine on trade in textile products
A. Letter from the Council of the European Union
1. I have the honour to refer to the negotiations held on 14 and 15 October 1999 between our respective Delegations with a view to renewing the Agreement between the European Community and Ukraine on trade in textile products including its annexes and agreed minutes ("the Agreement") initialled on 5 May 1993, as last amended and extended by the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters initialled on 9 November 1995.
2. During these negotiations both Parties restated their long-term objective of enhancing textiles and clothing trade between their countries. For this purpose it was agreed that the Parties would negotiate during the year 2000 a longer-term agreement aiming at the full liberalisation of trade in textiles, in parallel with alignment of Ukrainian tariffs to the rates applied by the European Community.
Such agreement will aim at the elimination, upon its entry into force, of quantitative restrictions for product categories whose utilisation rates were below 2 % in 1999 (categories 1, 2, 2A, 3, 9, 12, 20, 23, 37, 67 and 115).
3. The Parties agreed to amend the following provisions of the Agreement:
3.1. Annex I which sets out the products referred to in Article 1 of the Agreement shall be replaced by Annex I to EC Regulation 3030/93 (Appendix 1 to this letter gives further details).
3.2. Annex II which sets out the quantitative restrictions for exports from Ukraine to the European Community shall be replaced by Appendix 2 to this letter. For the year 1999 there will be an increase of 60 % for quantitative limits for textile categories 6, 7, 15 and 16, and an increase of 50 % for categories 5, 26/27, 29 and 50. For the year 2000, the increase will be, subject to the conditions and procedures of paragraph 5 of this letter, 30 % for all textile categories over the effective 1999 levels, with the exception of categories 5, 6, 7, 15, 16, 26/27, 29 and 50, which will be increased by 50 % over the effective 1999 levels.
3.3. The Annex to Protocol C which sets out the quantitative restrictions for exports from the Republic of Ukraine to the European Community after OPT operations in the Republic of Ukraine shall be replaced by Appendix 3 to this letter.
3.4. The second and third sentence of Article 20, paragraph 1, shall be replaced by the following text: "It shall be applicable until 31 December 2000."
4. The Parties agreed that imports into Ukraine of the textiles products originating in the Community and listed in Appendix 4 shall not exceed the rates of import duties described in that Appendix (products covered by chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonised System).
5. The Parties agreed that the balance of this Agreement, forming a package of mutual concessions, depends on the full and faithful implementation of all agreement terms. In order to monitor the implementation of the Agreement, both parties will hold consultations during the first quarter of 2000, in which the quantitative limits for the year 2000 as set out in Appendix 2 may also be reviewed in order to further facilitate the expansion of trade.
The increase of the levels of quantitative limits for the year 2000, as set out in Appendix 2, will be effected automatically upon confirmation that the tariff levels have been reduced to the levels established in Appendix 3. Ukraine undertakes to provide such confirmation by 31 March 2000.
The Parties also agreed that the volume of quantitative limits of year 2000 would be the same as those of 1999 until the moment when Ukraine applies the import tariff levels specified in Annex III.
6. In the case of non-application of these rates the Community will have the right to reintroduce for the year 2000 the levels for quantitative restrictions applicable for 1999 as specified in the Exchange of Letters initialled on 9 November 1995.
7. Should Ukraine become a Member to the World Trade Organisation before the date of expiry of the Agreement, this Agreement and its annexes will be applied and notified to the World Trade Organisation as an Administrative Arrangement, and its provisions will be applied within the framework of the Agreements and rules of the World Trade Organisation.
8. I should be obliged if you could kindly confirm the acceptance of your Government of the foregoing. Should this be the case, this Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters shall enter into force on the first day of the month following the day on which the Parties have notified each other that the legal procedures necessary to this end have been completed. In the meantime, it shall be applied provisionally no later than 1 December 1999 on the conditions to be specified in an Exchange of Notes (see Appendix 5).
Please accept, Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration.

It is understood that Article 1(2) clarifies the relationship between rights in phonograms under this Treaty and copyright in works embodied in the phonograms. In cases where authorisation is needed from both the author of a work embodied in the phonogram and a performer or producer owning rights in the phonogram, the need for the authorisation of the author does not cease to exist because the authorisation of the performer or producer is also required, and vice versa.
It is further understood that nothing in article 1(2) precludes a Contracting Party from providing exclusive rights to a performer or producer of phonograms beyond those required to be provided under this Treaty.
It is understood that the definition of phonogram provided in Article 2(b) does not suggest that rights in the phonogram are in any way affected through their incorporation into a cinematographic or other audiovisual work.
Concerning Articles 2(e), 8, 9, 12 and 13
Concerning Articles 7, 11 and 16
The reproduction right, as set out in Articles 7 and 11, and the exceptions permitted thereunder through Article 16, fully apply in the digital environment, in particular to the use of performances and phonograms in digital form. It is understood that the storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form in an electronic medium constitutes a reproduction within the meaning of these Articles.
It is understood that Article 15 does not represent a complete resolution of the level of rights of broadcasting and communication to the public that should be enjoyed by performers and phonogram producers in the digital age. Delegations were unable to achieve consensus on differing proposals for aspects of exclusivity to be provided in certain circumstances or for rights to be provided without the possibility of reservations, and have therefore left the issue so future resolution.
It is understood that Article 15 does not prevent the granting of the right conferred by this Article to performers of folklore and producers of phonograms recording folklore where such phonograms have not been published for commercial gain.
The agreed statement concerning Article 10 (on limitations and exceptions of the WIPO Copyright Treaty is applicable mutatis mutandis also to Article 16 (on limitations and exceptions) of the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty.
The agreed statement concerning Article 12 (on obligations concerning rights management information) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty is applicable mutatis mutandis also to Article 19 (on obligations concerning rights management information) of the WIPO Performance and Phonograms Treaty.

OBJECTIVES, PRINCIPLES AND ACTORS
The Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the ACP States, of the other part, hereinafter referred to as the "Parties" hereby conclude this Agreement in order to promote and expedite the economic, cultural and social development of the ACP States, with a view to contributing to peace and security and to promoting a stable and democratic political environment.
The partnership shall be centred on the objective of reducing and eventually eradicating poverty consistent with the objectives of sustainable development and the gradual integration of the ACP countries into the world economy.
These objectives and the Parties' international commitments shall inform all development strategies and shall be tackled through an integrated approach taking account at the same time of the political, economic, social, cultural and environmental aspects of development. The partnership shall provide a coherent support framework for the development strategies adopted by each ACP State.
Sustained economic growth, developing the private sector, increasing employment and improving access to productive resources shall all be part of this framework. Support shall be given to the respect of the rights of the individual and meeting basic needs, the promotion of social development and the conditions for an equitable distribution of the fruits of growth. Regional and sub-regional integration processes which foster the integration of the ACP countries into the world economy in terms of trade and private investment shall be encouraged and supported. Building the capacity of the actors in development and improving the institutional framework necessary for social cohesion, for the functioning of a democratic society and market economy, and for the emergence of an active and organised civil society shall be integral to the approach. Systematic account shall be taken of the situation of women and gender issues in all areas - political, economic and social. The principles of sustainable management of natural resources and the environment shall be applied and integrated at every level of the partnership.
ACP-EC cooperation, underpinned by a legally binding system and the existence of joint institutions, shall be exercised on the basis of the following fundamental principles:
- equality of the partners and ownership of the development strategies: for the purposes of implementing the objectives of the partnership, the ACP States shall determine the development strategies for their economies and societies in all sovereignty and with due regard for the essential elements described in Article 9; the partnership shall encourage ownership of the development strategies by the countries and populations concerned;
- participation: apart from central government as the main partner, the partnership shall be open to different kinds of other actors in order to encourage the integration of all sections of society, including the private sector and civil society organisations, into the mainstream of political, economic and social life;
- the pivotal role of dialogue and the fulfilment of mutual obligations: the obligations assumed by the Parties in the framework of their dialogue shall be central to their partnership and cooperation relations;
- differentiation and regionalisation: cooperation arrangements and priorities shall vary according to a partner's level of development, its needs, its performance and its long-term development strategy. Particular emphasis shall be placed on the regional dimension. Special treatment shall be given to the least-developed countries. The vulnerability of landlocked and island countries shall be taken into account.
Achievement of this Agreement's objectives
The Parties shall, each as far as it is concerned in the framework of this Agreement, take all appropriate measures, whether general or particular, to ensure the fulfilment of the obligations arising from this Agreement and to facilitate the attainment of the objectives thereof. They shall refrain from any measures liable to jeopardise these objectives.
The actors of the partnership
The ACP States shall determine the development principles, strategies and models of their economies and societies in all sovereignty. They shall establish, with the Community, the cooperation programmes provided for under this Agreement. However, the parties recognise the complementary role of and potential for contributions by non-State actors to the development process. To this end, under the conditions laid down in this Agreement, non-State actors shall, where appropriate:
- be informed and involved in consultation on cooperation policies and strategies, on priorities for cooperation especially in areas that concern or directly affect them, and on the political dialogue;
- be provided with financial resources, under the conditions laid down in this Agreement in order to support local development processes;
- be involved in the implementation of cooperation project and programmes in areas that concern them or where these actors have a comparative advantage;
- be provided with capacity-building support in critical areas in order to reinforce the capabilities of these actors, particularly as regards organisation and representation, and the establishment of consultation mechanisms including channels of communication and dialogue, and to promote strategic alliances.
Cooperation will support operation to provide more information and create greater awareness of the basic features of ACP-EU Partnership. Cooperation will also:
- encourage partnership and build links between ACP and EU actors;
- strengthen networking and exchange of expertise and experience among the actors.
1. The actors of cooperation will include:
(a) State (local, national and regional);
- Economic and social partners, including trade union organisations;
- Civil Society in all its forms according to national characteristics.
2. Recognition by the parties of non-governmental actors shall depend on the extent to which they address the needs of the population, on their specific competencies and whether they are organised and managed democratically and transparently.
The contribution of civil society to development can be enhanced by strengthening community organisations and non-profit non-governmental organisations in all spheres of cooperation. This will require:
- encouraging and supporting the creation and development of such organisations;
- establishing arrangements for involving such organisations in the design, implementation and evaluation of development strategies and programmes.
1. The Parties shall regularly engage in a comprehensive, balanced and deep political dialogue leading to commitments on both sides.
2. The objective of this dialogue shall be to exchange information, to foster mutual understanding, and to facilitate the establishment of agreed priorities and shared agendas, in particular by recognising existing links between the different aspects of the relations between the Parties and the various areas of cooperation as laid down in this Agreement. The dialogue shall facilitate consultations between the Parties within international fora. The objectives of the dialogue shall also include preventing situations arising in which one Party might deem it necessary to have recourse to the non-execution clause.
3. The dialogue shall cover all the aims and objectives laid down in this Agreement as well as all questions of common, general, regional or sub-regional interest. Through dialogue, the Parties shall contribute to peace, security and stability and promote a stable and democratic political environment. It shall encompass cooperation strategies as well as global and sectoral policies, including environment, gender, migration and questions related to the cultural heritage.
4. The dialogue shall focus, inter alia, on specific political issues of mutual concern or of general significance for the attainment of the objectives of this Agreement, such as the arms trade, excessive military expenditure, drugs and organised crime, or ethnic, religious or racial discrimination. The dialogue shall also encompass a regular assessment of the developments concerning the respect for human rights, democratic principles, the rule of law and good governance.
5. Broadly based policies to promote peace and to prevent, manage and resolve violent conflicts shall play a prominent role in this dialogue, as shall the need to take full account of the objective of peace and democratic stability in the definition of priority areas of cooperation.
6. The dialogue shall be conducted in a flexible manner. Dialogue shall be formal or informal according to the need, and conducted within and outside the institutional framework, in the appropriate format, and at the appropriate level including regional, sub-regional or national level.
7. Regional and sub-regional organisations as well as representatives of civil society organisations shall be associated with this dialogue.
Essential Elements and Fundamental Element
1. Cooperation shall be directed towards sustainable development centred on the human person, who is the main protagonist and beneficiary of development; this entails respect for and promotion of all human rights.
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including respect for fundamental social rights, democracy based on the rule of law and transparent and accountable governance are an integral part of sustainable development.
2. The Parties refer to their international obligations and commitments concerning respect for human rights. They reiterate their deep attachment to human dignity and human rights, which are legitimate aspirations of individuals and peoples. Human rights are universal, indivisible and inter-related. The Parties undertake to promote and protect all fundamental freedoms and human rights, be they civil and political, or economic, social and cultural. In this context, the Parties reaffirm the equality of men and women.
The Parties reaffirm that democratisation, development and the protection of fundamental freedoms and human rights are interrelated and mutually reinforcing. Democratic principles are universally recognised principles underpinning the organisation of the State to ensure the legitimacy of its authority, the legality of its actions reflected in its constitutional, legislative and regulatory system, and the existence of participatory mechanisms. On the basis of universally recognised principles, each country develops its democratic culture.
The structure of government and the prerogatives of the different powers shall be founded on rule of law, which shall entail in particular effective and accessible means of legal redress, an independent legal system guaranteeing equality before the law and an executive that is fully subject to the law.
Respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law, which underpin the ACP-EU Partnership, shall underpin the domestic and international policies of the Parties and constitute the essential elements of this Agreement.
3. In the context of a political and institutional environment that upholds human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law, good governance is the transparent and accountable management of human, natural, economic and financial resources for the purposes of equitable and sustainable development. It entails clear decision-making procedures at the level of public authorities, transparent and accountable institutions, the primacy of law in the management and distribution of resources and capacity building for elaborating and implementing measures aiming in particular at preventing and combating corruption.
Good governance, which underpins the ACP-EU Partnership, shall underpin the domestic and international policies of the Parties and constitute a fundamental element of this Agreement. The Parties agree that only serious cases of corruption, including acts of bribery leading to such corruption, as defined in Article 97 constitute a violation of that element.
4. The Partnership shall actively support the promotion of human rights, processes of democratisation, consolidation of the rule of law, and good governance.
These areas will be an important subject for the political dialogue. In the context of this dialogue, the Parties shall attach particular importance to the changes underway and to the continuity of the progress achieved. This regular assessment shall take into account each country's economic, social, cultural and historical context.
These areas will also be a focus of support for development strategies. The Community shall provide support for political, institutional and legal reforms and for building the capacity of public and private actors and civil society in the framework of strategies agreed jointly between the State concerned and the Community.
Other elements of the political environment
1. The Parties consider the following elements as contributing to the maintenance and consolidation of a stable and democratic political environment:
- sustainable and equitable development involving, inter alia, access to productive resources, essential services and justice;
- greater involvement of an active and organised civil society and the private sector.
2. The Parties recognise that the principles of the market economy, supported by transparent competition rules and sound economic and social policies, contribute to achieving the objectives of the partnership.
Peace-building policies, conflict prevention and resolution
1. The Parties shall pursue an active, comprehensive and integrated policy of peace-building and conflict prevention and resolution within the framework of the Partnership. This policy shall be based on the principle of ownership. It shall in particular focus on building regional, sub-regional and national capacities, and on preventing violent conflicts at an early stage by addressing their root-causes in a targeted manner, and with an adequate combination of all available instruments.
2. The activities in the field of peace-building, conflict prevention and resolution shall in particular include support for balancing political, economic, social and cultural opportunities among all segments of society, for strengthening the democratic legitimacy and effectiveness of governance, for establishing effective mechanisms for the peaceful conciliation of group interests, for bridging dividing lines among different segments of society as well as support for an active and organised civil society.
3. Relevant activities shall also include, inter alia, support for mediation, negotiation and reconciliation efforts, for effective regional management of shared, scarce natural resources, for demobilisation and reintegration of former combatants into the society, for addressing the problem of child soldiers, as well as for suitable action to set responsible limits to military expenditure and the arms trade, including through support for the promotion and application of agreed standards and codes of conduct. In this context, particular emphasis shall be given to the fight against anti-personnel landmines as well as to addressing an excessive and uncontrolled spread, illegal trafficking and accumulation of small arms and light weapons.
4. In situations of violent conflict the Parties shall take all suitable action to prevent an intensification of violence, to limit its territorial spread, and to facilitate a peaceful settlement of the existing disputes. Particular attention shall be paid to ensuring that financial resources for cooperation are used in accordance with the principles and objectives of the Partnership, and to preventing a diversion of funds for belligerent purposes.
5. In post-conflict situations, the Parties shall take all suitable action to facilitate the return to a non-violent, stable and self-sustainable situation. The Parties shall ensure the creation of the necessary links between emergency measures, rehabilitation and development cooperation.
Coherence of Community policies and their impact on the implementation of this Agreement
Without prejudice to Article 96, where the Community intends, in the exercise of its powers, to take a measure which might affect the interests of the ACP States, as far as this Agreement's objectives are concerned, it shall inform in good time the said States of its intentions. Towards this end, the Commission shall communicate simultaneously to the Secretariat of the ACP States its proposal for such measures. Where necessary, a request for information may also take place on the initiative of the ACP States.
At their request, consultations shall be held promptly so that account may be taken of their concerns as to the impact of those measures before any final decision is made.
After such consultations have taken place, the ACP States may, in addition, transmit their concerns in writing to the Community as soon as possible and submit suggestions for amendments indicating the way their concerns should be met.
If the Community does not accede to the ACP States' submissions, it shall advise them as soon as possible giving its reasons.
The ACP States shall also be provided with adequate information on the entry into force of such decisions, in advance whenever possible.
1. The issue of migration shall be the subject of in-depth dialogue in the framework of the ACP-EU Partnership.
The Parties reaffirm their existing obligations and commitments in international law to ensure respect for human rights and to eliminate all forms of discrimination based particularly on origin, sex, race, language and religion.
2. The Parties agree to consider that a partnership implies, with relation to migration, fair treatment of third country nationals who reside legally on their territories, integration policy aiming at granting them rights and obligations comparable to those of their citizens, enhancing non-discrimination in economic, social and cultural life and developing measures against racism and xenophobia.
3. The treatment accorded by each Member State to workers of ACP countries legally employed in its territory, shall be free from any discrimination based on nationality, as regards working conditions, remuneration and dismissal, relative to its own nationals. Further in this regard, each ACP State shall accord comparable non-discriminatory treatment to workers who are nationals of a Member State.
4. The Parties consider that strategies aiming at reducing poverty, improving living and working conditions, creating employment and developing training contribute in the long term to normalising migratory flows.
The Parties will take account, in the framework of development strategies and national and regional programming, of structural constraints associated with migratory flows with the purpose of supporting the economic and social development of the regions from which migrants originate and of reducing poverty.
The Community shall support, through national and regional Cooperation programmes, the training of ACP nationals in their country of origin, in another ACP country or in a Member State of the European Union. As regards training in a Member State, the Parties shall ensure that such action is geared towards the vocational integration of ACP nationals in their countries of origin.
The Parties shall develop cooperation programmes to facilitate the access of students from ACP States to education, in particular through the use of new communication technologies.
5. (a) In the framework of the political dialogue the Council of Ministers shall examine issues arising from illegal immigration with a view to establishing, where appropriate, the means for a prevention policy.
(b) In this context the Parties agree in particular to ensure that the rights and dignity of individuals are respected in any procedure initiated to return illegal immigrants to their countries of origin. In this connection the authorities concerned shall extend to them the administrative facilities necessary for their return.
(c) The Parties further agree that:
i) - each Member State of the European Union shall accept the return of and readmission of any of its nationals who are illegally present on the territory of an ACP State, at that State's request and without further formalities;

ECONOMIC AND TRADE COOPERATION
1. Economic and trade cooperation shall aim at fostering the smooth and gradual integration of the ACP States into the world economy, with due regard for their political choices and development priorities, thereby promoting their sustainable development and contributing to poverty eradication in the ACP countries.
2. The ultimate objective of economic and trade cooperation is to enable the ACP States to play a full part in international trade. In this context, particular regard shall be had to the need for the ACP States to participate actively in multilateral trade negotiations. Given the current level of development of the ACP countries, economic and trade cooperation shall be directed at enabling the ACP States to manage the challenges of globalisation and to adapt progressively to new conditions of international trade thereby facilitating their transition to the liberalised global economy.
3. To this end economic and trade cooperation shall aim at enhancing the production, supply and trading capacity of the ACP countries as well as their capacity to attract investment. It shall further aim at creating a new trading dynamic between the Parties, at strengthening the ACP countries trade and investment policies and at improving the ACP countries' capacity to handle all issues related to trade.
4. Economic and trade cooperation shall be implemented in full conformity with the provisions of the WTO, including special and differential treatment, taking account of the Parties' mutual interests and their respective levels of development.
1. Economic and trade cooperation shall be based on a true, strengthened and strategic partnership. It shall further be based on a comprehensive approach which builds on the strengths and achievements of the previous ACP-EC Conventions, using all means available to achieve the objectives set out above by addressing supply and demand side constraints. In this context, particular regard shall be had to trade development measures as a means of enhancing ACP States' competitiveness. Appropriate weight shall therefore be given to trade development within the ACP States' development strategies, which the Community shall support.
2. Economic and trade cooperation shall build on regional integration initiatives of ACP States, bearing in mind that regional integration is a key instrument for the integration of ACP countries into the world economy.
3. Economic and trade cooperation shall take account of the different needs and levels of development of the ACP countries and regions. In this context, the Parties reaffirm their attachment to ensuring special and differential treatment for all ACP countries and to maintaining special treatment for ACP LDCs and to taking due account of the vulnerability of small, landlocked and island countries.
1. In view of the objectives and principles set out above, the Parties agree to conclude new World Trade Organisation (WTO) compatible trading arrangements, removing progressively barriers to trade between them and enhancing cooperation in all areas relevant to trade.
2. The Parties agree that the new trading arrangements shall be introduced gradually and recognise the need, therefore, for a preparatory period.
3. In order to facilitate the transition to the new trading arrangements, the non-reciprocal trade preferences applied under the Fourth ACP-EC Convention shall be maintained during the preparatory period for all ACP countries, under the conditions defined in Annex V to this Agreement.
4. In this context, the Parties reaffirm the importance of the commodity protocols, attached to Annex V of this Agreement. They agree on the need to review them in the context of the new trading arrangements, in particular as regards their compatibility with WTO rules, with a view to safeguarding the benefits derived therefrom, bearing in mind the special legal status of the Sugar Protocol.
1. Economic partnership agreements shall be negotiated during the preparatory period which shall end by 31 December 2007 at the latest. Formal negotiations of the new trading arrangements shall start in September 2002 and the new trading arrangements shall enter into force by 1 January 2008, unless earlier dates are agreed between the Parties.
2. All the necessary measures shall be taken so as to ensure that the negotiations are successfully concluded within the preparatory period. To this end, the period up to the start of the formal negotiations of the new trading arrangements shall be actively used to make initial preparations for these negotiations.
3. The preparatory period shall also be used for capacity-building in the public and private sectors of ACP countries, including measures to enhance competitiveness, for strengthening of regional organisations and for support to regional trade integration initiatives, where appropriate with assistance to budgetary adjustment and fiscal reform, as well as for infrastructure upgrading and development, and for investment promotion.
4. The Parties will regularly review the progress of the preparations and negotiations and, will in 2006 carry out a formal and comprehensive review of the arrangements planned for all countries to ensure that no further time is needed for preparations or negotiations.
5. Negotiations of the economic partnership agreements will be undertaken with ACP countries which consider themselves in a position to do so, at the level they consider appropriate and in accordance with the procedures agreed by the ACP Group, taking into account regional integration process within the ACP.
6. In 2004, the Community will assess the situation of the non-LDC which, after consultations with the Community decide that they are not in a position to enter into economic partnership agreements and will examine all alternative possibilities, in order to provide these countries with a new framework for trade which is equivalent to their existing situation and in conformity with WTO rules.
7. Negotiations of the economic partnership agreements shall aim notably at establishing the timetable for the progressive removal of barriers to trade between the Parties, in accordance with the relevant WTO rules. On the Community side trade liberalisation shall build on the acquis and shall aim at improving current market access for the ACP countries through inter alia, a review of the rules of origin. Negotiations shall take account of the level of development and the socio-economic impact of trade measures on ACP countries, and their capacity to adapt and adjust their economies to the liberalisation process. Negotiations will therefore be as flexible as possible in establishing the duration of a sufficient transitional period, the final product coverage, taking into account sensitive sectors, and the degree of asymmetry in terms of timetable for tariff dismantlement, while remaining in conformity with WTO rules then prevailing.
8. The Parties shall closely cooperate and collaborate in the WTO with a view to defending the arrangements reached, in particular with regard to the degree of flexibility available.
9. The Community will start by the year 2000, a process which by the end of multilateral trade negotiations and at the latest 2005 will allow duty free access for essentially all products from all LDC building on the level of the existing trade provisions of the Fourth ACP-EC Convention and which will simplify and review the rules of origin, including cumulation provisions, that apply to their exports.
Joint Ministerial Trade Committee

3. They also agree on the importance of flexibility in WTO rules to take account of the ACP's level of development as well of the difficulties faced in meeting their obligations. They further agree on the need for technical assistance to enable the ACP countries to implement their commitments.
4. The Community agrees to assist the ACP States in their efforts, in accordance with the provisions set out in this Agreement, to become active members of these organisations, by developing the necessary capacity to negotiate, participate effectively, monitor and implement these agreements.
1. The Parties recognise the need to ensure a better operation of international commodity markets and to increase market transparency.
2. They confirm their willingness to step up consultations between them in the international fora and organisations dealing with commodities.
3. To this end, exchange of views shall take place at the request of either Party:
- regarding the operation of existing international agreements or specialised intergovernmental working parties with the aim of improving them and making them more effective, consistent with market trends;
- when it is proposed to conclude or renew an international agreement or set up a specialised intergovernmental working party.
The aim of such exchanges of views shall be to take account of the respective interest of each party. They may take place, where necessary, in the framework of the Ministerial Trade Committee.
1. The Parties underline the growing importance of services in international trade and their major contribution to economic and social development.
2. They reaffirm their respective commitments under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), and underline the need for special and differential treatment to ACP suppliers of services;
3. In the framework of the negotiations for progressive liberalisation in trade and services, as provided for in Article XIX of GATS, the Community undertakes to give sympathetic consideration to the ACP States' priorities for improvement in the EC schedule, with a view to meeting their specific interests.
4. The Parties further agree on the objective of extending under the economic partnership agreements, and after they have acquired some experience in applying the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) treatment under GATS, their partnership to encompass the liberalisation of services in accordance with the provisions of GATS and particularly those relating to the participation of developing countries in liberalisation agreements.
5. The Community shall support the ACP States' efforts to strengthen their capacity in the supply of services. Particular attention shall be paid to services related to labour, business, distribution, finance, tourism, culture and construction and related engineering services with a view to enhancing their competitiveness and thereby increasing the value and the volume of their trade in goods and services.
1. The Parties acknowledge the importance of cost-effective and efficient maritime transport services in a safe and clean marine environment as the main mode of transportation facilitating international trade and thereby constituting one of the forces behind economic development and the development of trade.
2. They undertake to promote the liberalisation of maritime transport and to this end apply effectively the principle of unrestricted access to the international maritime transport market on a non-discriminatory and commercial basis.
3. Each Party shall grant, inter alia, a treatment no less favourable than that accorded to its own ships, for ships operated by nationals or companies of the other Party, and for ships registered in the territory of either party, with respect to access to ports, the use of infrastructure and auxiliary maritime services of those ports, as well as related fees and charges, customs facilities and the assignment of berths and facilities for loading and unloading.
