(178) On the basis of the above, it is provisionally concluded that there are no compelling reasons not to impose provisional anti-dumping measures.
F. PROPOSAL FOR PROVISIONAL ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES
1. Injury elimination level
(179) In view of the provisional conclusions reached with regard to dumping, injury, causation and Community interest, provisional measures should be imposed in order to prevent further injury being caused to the Community industry by the dumped imports.
(180) For the purpose of establishing the level of the provisional measures, account has been taken of both the dumping margin found and the amount of duty necessary to eliminate the injury sustained by the Community industry.
(181) The provisional measures should be imposed at a level sufficient to eliminate the injury caused by these imports without exceeding the dumping margin found. When calculating the amount of duty necessary to remove the effects of the injurious dumping, it was considered that any measures should allow the Community industry to cover its costs of production and obtain overall a profit before tax that could be reasonably achieved by an industry of this type in the sector under normal conditions of competition, i.e. in the absence of dumped imports, on the sales of the like product in the Community. The pre-tax profit margin used for this calculation was 10 % of turnover. As demonstrated by the profit level of the Community industry before the imports concerned into the Community started to significantly increase, this 10 % profit can be considered as very conservative and reasonably expected in the absence of injurious dumping.
(182) On this basis a non-injurious price was calculated for the Community industry of the like product. The non-injurious price has been obtained by adding the above mentioned profit margin of 10 % to the cost of production.
(183) The necessary price increase was then determined on the basis of a comparison of the weighted average import price, as established for the undercutting calculations, with the average non-injurious price. Any difference resulting from this comparison was then expressed as a percentage of the average import cif value.
(184) In the light of the foregoing, it is considered that a provisional anti-dumping duty should be imposed at the level of the dumping margin found, but should not be higher than the injury margin calculated above in accordance with Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation.
(185) The individual company anti-dumping duty rates specified in this Regulation were established on the basis of the findings of the present investigations. Therefore, they reflect the situation found during these investigations with respect to the cooperating companies. These duty rates (as opposed to the countrywide duty applicable to "all other companies") are thus exclusively applicable to imports of products originating in the country concerned and produced by the companies and thus by the specific legal entities mentioned. Imported products produced by any other company not specifically mentioned in the operative part of this Regulation with its name and address, including entities related to those specifically mentioned, cannot benefit from these rates and shall be subject to the duty rate applicable to "all other companies".
[5] forthwith with all relevant information, in particular any modification in the company's activities linked to production, domestic and export sales associated with e.g. that name change or that change in the production and sales entities. If appropriate, the Regulation will accordingly be amended by updating the list of companies benefiting from individual duty rates.
(187) The proposed anti-dumping duties are the following:
Country | Company | Injury elimination margin | Dumping margin | Anti-dumping duty rate |
PRC | Hebei Jiheng Chemical Co. Limited | 62,6 % | 16,8 % | 16,8 % |
Nanning Chemical Industry Co. Limited | 60,6 % | 39,0 % | 39,0 % |

Heze Huayi Chemical Co. Limited | 62,8 % | 9,2 % | 9,2 % |
All other companies | 60,6 % | 40,3 % | 40,3 % |
USA | Biolab Inc. | 20,8 % | 68,4 % | 20,8 % |
Clearon Inc. | 28,5 % | 69,8 % | 28,5 % |
All other companies | 33,8 % | 98,5 % | 33,8 % |
(188) In the interest of sound administration, a period should be fixed within which the interested parties which made themselves known within the time limit specified in the notice of initiation may make their views known in writing and request a hearing. Furthermore, it should be stated that the findings concerning the imposition of duties made for the purposes of this Regulation are provisional and may have to be reconsidered for the purpose of any definitive duty,

Commission Regulation (EC) No 552/2005
of 11 April 2005
imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of certain magnesia bricks originating in the People's Republic of China
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Communities [1] (the basic Regulation) and in particular Article 7 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
(1) On 13 July 2004 the Commission announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union [2] the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding with regard to imports into the Community of certain magnesia bricks originating in the People’s Republic of China (PRC).
(2) The proceeding was initiated as a result of a complaint lodged 7 June 2004 by the European Refractories Producers Federation (P.R.E.) (the complainant) on behalf of producers representing a major proportion, in this case more than 50 %, of the total Community production of certain magnesia bricks. The complaint contained evidence of dumping of the product concerned and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding.
2. Parties concerned by the proceeding
(3) The Commission officially advised the complainant, other Community producers, the exporting producers, importers, suppliers and users as well as user associations known to be concerned, and representatives of the PRC of the opening of the proceeding. Interested parties were given an opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the notice of initiation.
(4) The complainant producers, other cooperating Community producers, exporting producers, importers, suppliers, users and user associations made their views known. All interested parties, who so requested and showed that there were particular reasons why they should be heard, were granted a hearing.
(5) In order to allow exporting producers in the PRC to submit a claim for market economy treatment (MET) or individual treatment (IT), if they so wished, the Commission sent market economy treatment and individual treatment claim forms to the Chinese companies known to be concerned. Eight companies requested MET pursuant to Article 2(7) of the basic Regulation or individual treatment should the investigation establish that they did not meet the conditions for MET and one company requested only IT.
(6) In the notice of initiation, the Commission indicated that sampling may be applied in this investigation. However, given the lower than expected number of exporting producers in the PRC which indicated their willingness to cooperate, it was decided that sampling was not required.
(7) The Commission sent questionnaires to all parties known to be concerned and to all other companies that made themselves known within the deadlines set out in the notice of initiation. Replies were received from the two Community producers included in the complaint, three other Community producers, nine exporting producers in the PRC, one trader related to one Chinese exporter and located in South Korea, one trader related to one Chinese exporter and located in the Isle of Man, two importers related to one Chinese exporter and located in the Community, five suppliers of raw materials, three unrelated importers and 16 unrelated users (steel producers) in the Community.
(8) The Commission sought and verified all the information deemed necessary for a provisional determination of dumping, resulting injury and Community interest and carried out verifications at the premises of the following companies:
- RHI AG, Austria (RHI)
- LWB Refractories GmbH, Germany (LWB)
- Refratechnik Holding GmbH, (responses from Refratechnik Cement GmbH and Refratechnik Steel GmbH, Germany (Refratechnik).
No on-spot verifications have been carried out with regard to Refractarios Burcena S.L., Spain and Ceramica Del Nalon SA, Spain as each of these two companies accounted only for a very small percentage of Community production.
(b) Exporting producers in the PRC:
- RHI Refractories Liaoning Co. Ltd
- Yingkou Kyushu Refractories Co. Ltd
- Yingkou Guangyang Refractories Co. Ltd
- Yingkou Sanhua Refractory Materials Co. Ltd
- Dashiqiao City Magnesite Refractory Factory Co. Ltd
- Dashiqiao Sanqiang Refractory Materials Co. Ltd
- Liaoning Mayerton Refractories Co. Ltd
- Yingkou Qinghua Refractories Co. Ltd
- Yingkou Orind Refractories Ltd.
- WonJin KR Co., Ltd, Yangsan-si, South Korea
- Mayerton Refractories Ltd, Isle of Man.
- Refratechnik Steel GmbH, Düsseldorf, Germany
- RHI AG Ltd, Vienna, Austria.
- Corus Group plc, London, United Kingdom
- Hüttenwerke Krupp Mannesmann GmbH, Duisburg, Germany.
(9) In light of the need to establish a normal value for exporting producers in the PRC to which MET might not be granted, a verification to establish normal value on the basis of data from an analogue country took place at the premises of the following companies:
Producers in the United States of America (USA):
- LWB Refractories Company
- Resco Products Inc.
3. Investigation period (IP)
(10) The investigation of dumping and injury covered the period from 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004 (IP). The examination of trends relevant for the assessment of injury covered the period from 1 January 2001 to the end of the investigation period (period considered).
4. Product concerned and like product
(11) Magnesia bricks are normally used in steel production as a lining of the vessels in which the steel is melted. The product is normally produced to standard chemical specifications which are then altered to fit the demands of the end user. Accordingly, the number of individual product types is vast. Therefore, it has been decided to classify the product according to certain groupings for comparison purposes.
(12) The product concerned is chemically bonded, unfired magnesia bricks, whose magnesia component contains at least 80 % MgO, whether or not containing magnesite, originating in the PRC (the product concerned), normally declared within CN codes ex68159100 and ex68159910. However, the investigation has shown that the product concerned was also imported under CN codes ex68151010, ex68159990, ex69021000, ex69039020 and ex69039090 (ex69039020 before 1 January 2004).
(13) The investigation has shown that all types of the product concerned as defined in the preceding recital, despite differences in a variety of factors such as, inter alia, the ratio between the different raw materials, additives and post treatments, shapes and sizes are used for the same purposes.
(14) No differences were found between the product concerned and the magnesia bricks produced and sold on the domestic market in the PRC and the USA, which served as an analogue country for the purpose of establishing the normal value with respect to imports from the PRC. Indeed, these magnesia bricks have the same basic physical and chemical characteristics and uses compared with those exported from the PRC to the Community.
(15) Likewise, no differences were found between the product concerned and the magnesia bricks produced by the complainant and sold on the Community market. They both share the same physical and chemical characteristics and uses.
(16) It is therefore concluded that all types of magnesia bricks form one product and are considered to be alike within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation.
1. Market Economy Treatment (MET)
(17) Pursuant to Article 2(7)(b) of the basic Regulation, in anti-dumping investigations concerning imports originating in the PRC, normal value shall be determined in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 6 of the said Article for those producers which were found to meet the criteria laid down in Article 2(7)(c). Briefly, and for ease of reference only, these criteria are set out in summarised form below:
- business decisions and costs are made in response to market conditions,
- accounting records are independently audited and applied for all purposes,
- there are no significant distortions carried over from former non-market economy system,
- legal certainty and stability is provided by bankruptcy and property laws,
- currency exchanges are carried out at the market rate.
(18) Eight exporting producers in the PRC requested MET pursuant to Article 2(7)(b) of the basic Regulation and replied to the MET claim form for exporting producers.
(19) For the eight exporting producers and their related companies involved in the production and/or commercialisation of the product concerned located in the PRC, the Commission sought and verified at the premises of these companies all information submitted in the MET applications as deemed necessary.
(20) The investigation revealed that two out of the eight Chinese exporting producers fulfilled all of the conditions for granting MET. The two exporting producers in the PRC which obtained MET are:
- Yingkou Sanhua Refractory Materials Co. Ltd
- Liaoning Mayerton Refractories Co. Ltd.
(21) The remaining six claims had to be rejected. The following table summarises the determination for the six companies for which MET was not granted against each of the five criteria as set out in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation.
Company | Criteria |
Criterion 1Article 2(7)(c) indent 1 | Criterion 2Article 2(7)(c) indent 2 | Criterion 3Article 2(7)(c) indent 3 | Criterion 4Article 2(7)(c) indent 4 | Criterion 5Article 2(7)(c) indent 5 |
1 | Met | Met | Not met | Met | Met |
2 | No decision | Not met | Met | Met | Met |
3 | No decision | Not met | Met | Met | Met |
4 | Not met | Not met | Not met | Met | Met |
5 | Not met | Not met | Met | Met | Met |
6 | Not met | Not met | Not met | Met | Met |
(22) The companies concerned and the complainant were given an opportunity to comment on the above findings.
(23) All six exporting producers submitted that the determination was wrong and that MET should be granted to them for the reasons set out below:
(24) Concerning criterion 1, one company argued that although a risk of State interference exists, it does not take place in practice. Other companies referred to Article VI of the GATT 1994 and doubted whether the Commission’s decision was in line with WTO law. They claimed that since it had been shown in this investigation that there was no State Monopoly on the manufacture and sale of the product and that there is no evidence that the Chinese Government has fixed all domestic sales prices for magnesium bricks, the companies had discharged their burden of proof that free competition and accordingly market economy conditions prevail with regard to the manufacture and sale of the product.
(25) As acknowledged by the Court of First Instance, the burden of proof is on the exporting producer to demonstrate that it fulfils MET criteria. More importantly, during the investigation it was found that the company is established under the special Township law which provides possibilities for state interference and no exceptions to the application of this law were found to exist. Any re-negotiation of the Articles of Association would still leave untouched the status of the company. It was found that the local authority is involved in major decisions. Moreover, no independent evaluation was made as to whether the investments in the company reflect fair market prices, neither when the company was established nor when additional capital was inserted later into the company. The company has, in addition, according to the Business Licence, the possibility to make compensatory trade and barter trade and could not prove that this had not taken place. Based on the above, the Commission concluded that that the company did not meet criterion 1. On this basis, and in line with the basic Regulation, which also reflects the Community’s international obligations arising from the WTO, the arguments therefore have to be rejected.
(26) Concerning criterion 2, some companies claimed that the alleged deficiencies in their accounting practices were irrelevant for the question of whether market economy conditions prevail with regard to the manufacture, and sale of the product. Moreover, these companies argued that, imposing such additional requirements as an obligation to use international standards, is unrelated to the issue of whether market economy conditions prevail. They claimed that it is a violation of the Community’s obligations under GATT/WTO, in particular a violation of the explanatory note of GATT Article VI as well as Paragraph 15 (a)(ii) of the Decision of 10 November 2001, i.e. the Protocol on the accession of the People's Republic of China.
(27) Furthermore, some companies argued that by imposing the obligation to apply international accounting standards (IAS) on foreign exporters while they are not imposed on the domestic industry, the Community applies its trade laws not in an "impartial" way. Thus, it is claimed that the Community industry is put in a more favourable position than exporters. However, it is to be noted that the analysis of whether the companies fulfilled the criteria for obtaining market economy treatment was carried out on the basis of Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation. Since this evaluation has not been done for the Community industry it cannot be said that the Commission is partial in its analysis. Therefore, this argument is not relevant in this case. As far as the first claim is concerned, under Article 2(7)(c) indent 2 of the basic Regulation, the Commission has to examine if the companies have one clear set of basic accounting records which are independently audited in line with international accounting standards and are applied for all purposes. The companies in questions did not fulfil these necessary conditions of the quoted criterion and did not follow the basic principles of accounting. Therefore, this claim had to be rejected.
(28) Concerning criterion 3, a company claimed that their assets were indeed valued independently. However, no conclusive proof has been provided that assets are recorded at the real market value and it has not been demonstrated that all costs are taken into account at market value.
(29) Further to Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation, a country-wide duty, if any, is established for countries falling under Article 2(7), except in those cases where companies are able to demonstrate, in accordance with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation, that (i) in case of wholly or partly foreign owned firms or joint ventures, exporters are free to repatriate capital and profits; (ii) their export prices and quantities as well as the conditions and terms of the sales are freely determined; (iii) the majority of the shares belongs to private persons, State officials appearing on the board of Directors or holding key management positions are in minority or it is demonstrated that the company is nonetheless sufficiently independent from the State interference (iv) exchange rate conversions are carried out at market rates; (v) any State interference is not such as to permit circumvention of measures if individual exporters are given different rates of duty.
(30) The six exporting producers to which MET could not be granted also claimed individual treatment (IT) in the event they were not granted MET. On the basis of the information available, it was found that four of them met all of the requirements for IT as set forth in Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation.
(31) Of the two remaining companies, one was found to be partially State owned. In addition, the company was established under special Chinese legislation which provides possibilities for state interference. The company could not demonstrate that it took its decisions free of such state interference. For these reasons, the risk of State interference was deemed significant. Moreover, it is usually very difficult, in particular for customs authorities, to identify the producer of any magnesia brick traded. Therefore, the risk of circumvention of measures by way of exporting via a company with a lower level of duty, which is aggravated by the fact that there is significant risk of state interference, was also deemed significant. Consequently, the conditions set in Article 9(5)(c) and (e) of the basic Regulation were not met. It was therefore decided not to grant IT to this company.
(32) For the remaining company, the level of cooperation and the data provided was not sufficient to allow for a determination as to whether the company fulfilled all the criteria to be granted IT. For instance, the company was not able to provide, within the deadlines, a reliable transaction listing of its sales to the Community, thereby preventing any calculation of a dumping margin to be made.
(33) One additional exporting producer requested only individual treatment. This company had sales to related companies in the Community as well as sales to independent parties in the Community. As the company failed to provide the requested information within the deadlines given, the determination as to whether the company fulfilled all the criteria to be granted IT could not be made and the company had to be regarded as a non-cooperating party.
(34) It was therefore concluded that IT should be granted to the following four exporting producers in the PRC:
- Yingkou Kyushu Refractories Co. Ltd
- Yingkou Guangyang Refractories Co. Ltd
- Dashiqiao Sanqiang Refractory Materials Co. Ltd
- Yingkou Qinghua Refractories Co. Ltd.
3.1. Determination of normal value for all exporting producers not granted MET
(35) According to Article 2(7) of the basic Regulation, in case of imports from non-market-economy countries and to the extent that MET could not be granted, for countries specified in Article 2(7)(b) of the basic Regulation, normal value has to be established on the basis of the price or constructed value in an analogue country.
(36) In the notice of initiation the Commission indicated its intention to use Turkey as an appropriate analogue country for the purpose of establishing normal value for the PRC and invited the interested parties to comment on this.
(37) Some interested parties objected to this proposal. The main arguments against Turkey, claimed by them, were:
- insufficient competition on the Turkish domestic market (there are only 3 Turkish producers),
- Turkey’s volume of production amounts to 1,3 % of Chinese production,
- Chinese producers have a different cost structure, especially with regard to labour costs and the cost of raw materials,
- PRC and Turkey have different economic and cultural ties with the EU, such as being closer to Europe, benefiting from a customs union with the EU since 1995, and their harmonising of laws with EU standards in light of negotiations on Turkey’s accession to the EU,
- the Turkish currency was strongly devalued; some Turkish producers are related/linked to complainants,
- and the quality of Turkish products is too low.
(38) The interested parties suggested India or Russia as appropriate analogue countries.
(39) The Commission sought cooperation from other potential analogue countries such as: Russia, India, Japan, South Korea, United States of America, Turkey, Serbia Montenegro and South Africa. Out of 38 companies which were contacted all over the world, only two companies from the USA agreed to cooperate.
(40) The analysis of the information available showed that the USA has a competitive market for the product concerned with at least three producers, around 30 suppliers, more than 15 importers and approximately 300 users. No differences were found to exist between the product concerned and the magnesia bricks produced and sold on the domestic market in the PRC and in the USA as stated in recital 14. In addition, it was found that over 50 % of the raw material used by one of the producers in the USA was imported from PRC and that there are no significant differences in the production process used in the two countries to produce magnesia bricks.
(41) In view of the above it is provisionally concluded that the United States of America represented the most appropriate and reasonable choice of analogue country in accordance with Article 2(7) of the basic Regulation.
(b) Determination of normal value
(42) Pursuant to Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation, the normal value for the exporting producers not granted MET was established on the basis of verified information received from the producers in the analogue country. Since the transactions by the producers in the USA were found to be made in the ordinary course of trade, the normal value was established on the basis of all prices paid or payable on the domestic market of the USA for product types comparable to those exported to the Community by the Chinese exporters.
(43) Normal value was established as the weighted average domestic sales price charged to unrelated customers by the cooperating producers in the USA for product types having similar MgO content. Where relevant, adjustments were made for the different treatments incurred by the various product types.
3.2. Determination of normal value for exporting producers granted MET
(44) It is recalled that for the companies granted MET the calculation of any dumping margin was based on the data they submitted on domestic export sales and on the cost of production for the product concerned. This data was verified at the premises of the companies concerned.
(45) As far as the determination of normal value is concerned, the Commission first established, for each cooperating exporting producer, whether its total domestic sales of the product concerned were representative in comparison with its total export sales to the Community. In accordance with Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation, domestic sales were considered representative when the total volume of such sales of each exporting producer represented at least 5 % of the total export sales volume of the producer to the Community.
(46) On this basis, it was found that one exporting producer had overall domestic sales of the product concerned which were made in representative quantities during the IP. For the other exporting producer the overall domestic sales of the product concerned during the IP were not made in representative quantities.
(47) For the exporting producer with representative domestic sales, the Commission subsequently identified those types of magnesia bricks, sold domestically that were identical or directly comparable to the types sold for export to the Community.
(48) For each type sold on its domestic market and found to be directly comparable to the type of magnesia bricks sold for export to the Community, it was established whether domestic sales were sufficiently representative for the purposes of Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation. Domestic sales of a particular type of magnesia bricks were considered sufficiently representative when the total domestic sales volume of that type during the IP represented 5 % or more of the total sales volume of the comparable magnesia bricks type exported to the Community.
(49) As a result of this analysis, it was found that the exporting producer with overall representative sales only had representative domestic sales for a few product types.
(50) The Commission subsequently examined whether the domestic sales of each type of magnesia bricks sold domestically in representative quantities could be regarded as having been made in the ordinary course of trade, by establishing the proportion of profitable sales to independent customers of the magnesia bricks type in question.
(51) Domestic sales transactions were considered profitable where the unit price of a specific product type was equal to or above the cost of production. Cost of production of each type sold on the domestic market during the IP was therefore determined.
(52) As mentioned in recitals 50 and 51, the proportion of profitable sales to independent customers in the domestic market of the product type in question was established. In cases where the sales volume of a specific magnesia bricks type, sold at a net sales price equal to or above the calculated cost of production, represented 80 % or more of the total sales volume of that type, and where the weighted average price of that type was equal to or above the cost of production, normal value was based on the actual domestic price, calculated as a weighted average of the prices of all domestic sales of that type made during the IP, irrespective of whether these sales were profitable or not. In cases where the volume of profitable sales of magnesia bricks type represented less than 80 % of the total sales volume of that type, or where the weighted average price of that type was below the cost of production, normal value was based on the actual domestic price, calculated as a weighted average of the profitable sales of that type only, provided that these sales represented 10 % or more of the total sales volume of that type.
(53) In cases where the volume of profitable sales of any type of magnesia bricks represented less than 10 % of the total sales volume of that type, it was considered that this particular type was sold in insufficient quantities for the domestic price to provide an appropriate basis for the establishment of the normal value.
(54) As a result of the above analysis, it was found that certain product types were sold in the ordinary course of trade.
(55) For all the product types which were either not sold in representative quantities or which were not sold in the ordinary course of trade by reason of price as set out in recitals 52 and 53, domestic prices of the exporting producer in question could not be used in order to establish normal value and another method had to be applied.
(56) Wherever domestic prices of a particular type sold by an exporting producer could not be used, constructed normal value had to be calculated based on the costs of the producer in question. Consequently, in accordance with Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation, normal value was constructed by adding to the manufacturing costs of the exported types, adjusted where necessary, a reasonable amount for selling, general and administrative (SG%amp%A) expenses and a reasonable margin of profit. To this end, the Commission examined whether the SG%amp%A incurred and the profit realised on the domestic market constituted reliable data.
(57) Actual domestic SG%amp%A expenses were considered reliable when the total domestic sales volume of the company concerned could be regarded as representative when compared to the volume of export sales to the Community. The domestic profit margin was determined on the basis of domestic sales of those types which were sold in the ordinary course of trade. For this purpose, the methodology set out in recitals 45, 48, 52 and 53 was applied. For one company, their own SGA and profit could be used because it met the aforementioned criteria.
(58) For the other company which did not have sufficient domestic sales, the normal value was established on the basis of Article 2(6)(c) of the basic Regulation. It was found that the cost structure of the other company granted MET which had representative domestic sales for some types was so different that it did not constitute a reasonable basis to establish normal value in this case. The costs of the company which did not have representative domestic sales was, however, found reliable and normal value was constructed based on the data of the company as they were in line with those of other exporters or producers of the same product in the country of origin.
(59) All export sales to the Community of exporters granted MET or IT were made either via related importers in the Community, via related companies outside the Community or via companies which, whilst not related to the exporting producers nevertheless had a close cooperation with or even an exclusive trading contract. In the cases where the exports were made via related companies the export prices were constructed pursuant to Article 2(9) of the basic Regulation. In all cases, where the product concerned was exported to independent customers in the Community, the export price was established in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation, namely on the basis of export prices actually paid or payable.
(60) Adjustments were made for all costs incurred between importation and resale by that importer, including SG%amp%A expenses, and a reasonable profit margin, in accordance with Article 2(9) of the basic Regulation. In this case, the actual profit margin realised by the cooperating unrelated importers was deemed to be a reasonable basis.
(61) The normal value and export prices were compared on an ex-factory basis and at the same level of trade. In order to ensure a fair comparison between normal value and export price, account was taken, in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation, of differences in factors which were claimed and demonstrated to affect prices and price comparability.
(62) On this basis, allowances for differences in transport, insurance, handling, loading and ancillary costs, credit, commissions, import charges and after sales costs (warranty/guarantee) were made.
6.1. For the cooperating exporting producers granted MET/IT
(63) For the two companies granted MET, the weighted average normal value of each type of the product concerned exported to the Community was compared with the weighted average export price of the corresponding type of the product concerned, as provided for under Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation.
(64) For the four companies granted individual treatment, the weighted average normal value for each type exported to the Community established for the analogue country was compared with the weighted average export price of the corresponding type exported to the Community, as provided for under Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation.
(65) The provisional weighted average dumping margins expressed as a percentage of the cif Community frontier price duty unpaid are:
—Liaoning Mayerton Refractories Co. Ltd | 11,2 % |
—Yingkou Sanhua Refractory Materials Co. Ltd | 34,1 % |
—Yingkou Guangyang Refractories Co. Ltd | 55,7 % |
—Yingkou Kyushu Refractories Co. Ltd | 55,7 % |
—Dashiqiao Sanqiang Refractory Materials Co. Ltd | 99,9 % |
—Yingkou Qinghua Refractories Co. Ltd | 41,4 %. |
(66) In order to calculate the dumping margin applicable to all other exporters in the PRC, the Commission first established the level of cooperation. A comparison was made between the total imports of the product concerned originating in the PRC calculated on the basis of Eurostat, according to the methodology established in recital 80, and the actual questionnaire replies received from exporters in the PRC. On this basis, it was established that the level of cooperation was low.
(67) As the cooperation was low, the dumping margin applicable to all other exporters in the PRC was established at the level of the highest dumping margin calculated for the cooperating exporting producers, i.e. 99,9 % of the cif Community frontier price duty unpaid. Nonetheless, the countrywide dumping margin was found to be above the residual injury margin.
(68) In the course of the present investigation it was found that magnesia bricks were manufactured by:
- two complainant Community producers and two other producers, which fully cooperated with the Commission during the investigation (RHI, LWB, Refractarios Burceña S.L. and Ceramica Del Nalon SA),
- one producer, which provided a detailed questionnaire reply, but opposed the proceeding (Refratechnik),
- seven other producers plus Assopiatrelle (the Italian Refractories Association representing 64000 tonnes of production), which supported the Community industry but did not provide a detailed questionnaire reply. One further producer submitted a letter but did not express support or opposition.
2. Definition of the Community industry
2.1. Producers related to the PRC and/or importing the product concerned from the PRC
(69) It was found that two of the cooperating producers within the Community also imported the product concerned from the PRC: RHI and Refratechnik. It was, therefore, examined whether these companies should be excluded from the definition of the Community industry according to Article 4(1)(a) of the basic Regulation.
(70) RHI produces in the Community but also imports the product concerned from a related joint-venture company in the PRC: RHI Liaoning. It has been found that the vast majority of RHI’s sales on the Community market were produced in the Community in the IP, whereas only a minor part was produced in the PRC. This share is low because RHI’s production in the PRC is mainly aimed at the fast growing Asian market. RHI is also the biggest producer in the Community and its headquarters, R%amp%D centre and biggest production sites are all located in the Community. It was therefore found that RHI’s core business is situated in the Community as regards the product concerned.
(71) It was further examined what impact the imported sales had on the company’s total Community sales. It was found that RHI was not enjoying substantial, in terms of profitability, beneficial effects by reselling imports. This conclusion was reached after comparing the profitability rates of the cooperating Community producers.
(72) Considering the low import share and the absence of any substantial benefits from these imports on the profitability of all Community sales, it has been established that this company has not been shielded from the negative consequences of the injurious dumping. Therefore, it is considered that an exclusion of RHI from the definition of the Community industry would not be justified.
(73) Refratechnik also produces in the Community and imports the product concerned from producers in the PRC. It has been found that almost half of Refratechnik’s sales on the Community market were produced in the PRC in the IP. It was also found that most of the expansion of their business is made through increased imports from the PRC. It was, therefore, considered that Refratechnik’s core business is not only situated in the Community but also in the PRC.
(74) It was further examined what impact the imported sales had on the company’s total Community sales. It was found that Refratechnik, in contrast to RHI, was significantly benefiting by reselling imports.
(75) Bearing in mind the high share of imports compared to total Community sales volumes, the fact that the core of the business seems to be gradually shifting to the PRC and the fact that Refratechnik was clearly benefiting from the dumped imports, it is considered that Refratechnik should be excluded from the Community industry according to Article 4(1)(a) of the basic Regulation and will be considered as "another operator on the market".
(76) The production of the four Community producers that fully cooperated in the investigation including RHI and excluding Refratechnik was at 233732 tonnes during the investigation period. This represents 53 % of total Community production and these companies therefore constitute the Community industry within the meaning of Articles 4(1) and 5(4) of the basic Regulation.
(77) The investigation established that there was no captive use of the product concerned within the magnesia bricks producing industry. However, some steel companies produced magnesia bricks for their own use. This volume was small in comparison to volumes produced by the Community refractory producers. Since this production is for the use within the steel industry and none of the steel industry companies cooperated as producers of magnesia bricks (although many of them received questionnaires), this part of production seems to have no significant impact on the Community industry.
(78) As the Community industry was made up of four companies, two of which comprised around 2 % of volume produced, the Community industry data shown below has been indexed for confidentiality reasons.
(79) Consumption was established from standard industry estimates provided by the Community industry according to normal industry practice. This data was calculated based on steel production reports (source — International Iron %amp% Steel Institute (IISI), divided by known average use of the product concerned per tonne of steel produced.
(80) Eurostat information related to import volumes for the relevant CN Codes (68159100, 68159910, 68151010, 68159990, 69021000 and 69039020) were used as the source of the import data. Deductions were made from these figures in order to exclude products which, based on their price, were clearly not the product concerned. This volume net of deductions (which for all countries equalled 73291 tonnes and for the PRC equalled 59831tonnes) was compared to import volumes reported by the Chinese cooperating exporting producers (around 42000 tonnes). Bearing in mind that (i) around 13500 tonnes was imported from countries other than the PRC; (ii) data from Community importers and users showed that imports were made from non-cooperating exporters in PRC; and (iii) many other exporting producers in the PRC received a questionnaire but did not cooperate, the Eurostat figure was considered to be an accurate assessment of import volumes. In addition, a Chinese trade press source (China Metallurgical News, 4 January 2004) reported that 80000 tonnes were exported to Europe in 2003 which also suggests that the above Eurostat figure for the IP (59831) is by no means excessive.
(81) Community industry sales on the Community market were obtained from the verified questionnaire responses of the five cooperating Community producers (including Refratechnik). The balance (i.e. consumption minus imports, minus Community industry sales volumes) was deemed to be sales volumes of non-cooperating Community producers.
(82) This consumption, as presented in the following table, shows that demand of the product concerned in the Community was stable over the period considered.
| 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP |
Community consumption | 399563 | 397203 | 401499 | 400638 |
Index 2001 = 100 | 100 | 99 | 100 | 100 |
4. Imports into the Community from the country concerned
4.1. Market share of imports concerned
(83) The evolution of imports from the country concerned, in volume and market share, has been the following:
Import volumes | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP |
PRC | 23980 | 44542 | 54181 | 59831 |
Index 2001 = 100 | 100 | 186 | 226 | 250 |
Market shares of the imports | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP |
PRC | 6,0 % | 11,2 % | 13,5 % | 14,9 % |
(84) Whereas the consumption of magnesia bricks remained stable during the period under consideration, the imports from the country concerned have risen by around 150 % in the same period. In consequence, the market share of the PRC has more than doubled during the period considered from 6,0 % to 14,9 %.
4.2. Prices of imports and undercutting
| 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP |
Import prices from the PRC (Source: Eurostat) | 686 | 601 | 560 | 533 |
Index 2001 = 100 | 100 | 88 | 82 | 78 |
(85) The above table shows the development of average import prices from the PRC. Over the period considered prices fell by 22 %.
(86) A comparison of selling prices on the Community market during the IP was made between the prices of the Community industry and those of the exporting producers in the country concerned. This comparison was made after deduction of rebates and discounts. The prices of the Community industry were adjusted to ex-works prices, and the prices of the imports were cif Community frontier.
(87) The comparison showed that during the IP imports of the product concerned were sold in the Community at prices which undercut the Community industry’s prices, when expressed as a percentage of the latter by 16,6 %. From this level of undercutting and the price development of the Community industry, as explained below, it is clear that substantial price depression had already taken place.
5. Situation of the Community industry
(88) In accordance with Article 3(5) of the basic Regulation, the examination of the impact of the dumped imports on the Community industry included an evaluation of all economic factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the industry from 2001 (base year) to the IP.
(89) The Community industry data below represent the aggregated information of the four cooperating Community producers.
5.1. Production, production capacity and capacity utilisation
(90) The evolution of production, production capacity and capacity utilisation is the following:
Indices 2001 = 100 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP |
Production (tonnes) | 100 | 88 | 89 | 91 |
Production capacity (tonnes) | 100 | 90 | 84 | 84 |
Production utilisation (%) | 100 | 98 | 106 | 108 |
(91) As shown in the table above, production during the period considered decreased by 9 %. Production capacity was reduced by 16 % in order to cut costs which led to an 8 % increase in capacity utilisation.
(92) The figures below represent the volume of stocks at the end of each period:
| 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP |
Stocks (tonnes) | | | | |
Index 2001 = 100 | 100 | 109 | 105 | 108 |
(93) Stocks have increased during the period considered by 8 %. It is to be noted that the Community industry generally produces the product concerned to order. Consequently, the level of stocks held by the Community industry was found not to be a significant indicator in the assessment of the situation of the Community industry.
5.3. Sales volume, market shares, growth and average unit prices in the Community
(94) The figures below represent the Community industry’s sales to independent customers in the Community.
Indices 2001 = 100 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP |
Sales volume (tonnes) | 100 | 97 | 99 | 100 |
Market Share | 100 | 97 | 98 | 100 |
Average sales prices (EUR/tonne) | 100 | 98 | 89 | 89 |
(95) The Community industry’s sales volumes and market share were stable during the period considered. However, this was only achieved at the expense of a reduction in average sales prices of 11 % as dumped imports penetrated the Community market.
(96) It must also be noted that the decrease in average prices of 11 % is understated vis-à-vis the fall in prices of major product segments. The product concerned is used in the steel industry for lining three main types of vessels; ladles, converters and electric arc furnaces. Initially, Chinese imports were mainly in the low value segment of ladle bricks. However, over the period concerned there has been a trend towards penetration of the converters and electric arc furnace segments. The utilisation of converters and electric arc furnaces needs to be maximised and more high quality and high cost bricks are required to increase the number of heats before a lining is changed. An analysis of sales patterns over the period considered showed that the Community industry moved more into the lower volume but higher value segments in order to defend itself from the pressure from Chinese imports. With this in mind, it is clear that average prices for some individual product types have fallen by more than 11 %. For example the average price of the largest brick group (containing 9 % residual carbon and fused magnesia) fell by 19 % over the period considered.
(97) Facing increasing imports, the Community industry could not grow despite reducing its average prices. In contrast, they were forced to reduce production capacity and work force.
(98) The profitability shown below is return on turnover (RoT), in terms of sales on the Community market.
| 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP |
Profitability on Community Sales (RoT) | 100 | 76 | 26 | 45 |
(99) The profitability decreased substantially from 2001 to 2003 due to the reduced prices and coincided with increases of dumped imports from the PRC. Profitability slightly improved in the IP, which was achieved mainly because of reduced costs. Furthermore, the profit level during the IP, although above breakeven, was well below a level which this type of industry could be expected to achieve in the absence of dumped imports. As can be seen in the year 2001, when dumped imports still held a relatively low market share, the profit level which could be expected would be much higher.
5.5. Return on investments, cash flow, investments and ability to raise capital
(100) The trends for the return on investments, cash flow and investments are shown in the following table.
Indices 2001 = 100 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP |
Return on investments | 100 | 85 | 50 | 52 |
Cash flow | 100 | 81 | 55 | 60 |
Investments | 100 | 75 | 131 | 134 |
(101) It is noted that the above trend figures for return on investments reflect to a large extent those on profitability (return on turnover) above. The cash flow also shows approximately the same trend, namely decreasing from 2001 to 2003 and a slight improvement in the IP. The falling return on investments and cash flow resulted from the fact that average sales prices were falling more quickly than the average costs for products sold.
(102) The Community industry has increased its investments. These were replacement investments in plant and machinery rather than investments in new production facilities.
(103) The Community industry’s ability to raise capital, either from external providers of finance or parent companies, was nevertheless not seriously affected during the period considered because the companies belong to larger groups. Thus, the ability to raise capital is primarily judged on the basis of the strength of the group and not necessarily on the basis of the merits of the business sector concerned. Therefore, this factor does not seem to be relevant for this investigation.
5.6. Employment, productivity and wages
Indices 2001 = 100 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP |
Number of employees | 100 | 91 | 92 | 93 |
Productivity (tonne/employee) | 100 | 96 | 98 | 98 |
Wages | 100 | 84 | 82 | 82 |
(104) As seen above, the Community industry decreased its number of employees from 2001 to the IP. The increase in 2003 to the IP can be explained by increased production. Productivity was largely stable over the period.
(105) Wages decreased substantially in 2002 but have remained stable up to the IP. This was due to a programme of restructuring in that year as can be seen from production and employment trends shown above.
5.7. Magnitude of the actual margin of dumping
(106) The dumping margins are specified above in the dumping section. These margins established are clearly above de minimis. Furthermore, given the volume and the price of the dumped imports, the impact of the actual margin of dumping cannot be considered to be negligible.
5.8. Effects of past dumping or subsidisation
(107) The Community industry is not recovering from the effects of past dumping or subsidization since no such previous investigations have been made.
5.9. Conclusion on injury
(108) It is recalled that while sales volumes and market share in the Community were relatively stable, the Community industry suffered average prices decreases of 11 % in the period considered, despite developing its product mix to higher value product types. Notwithstanding cost cuts, profit levels decreased significantly resulting in a profit in the IP which is 55 % below the level in 2001 and is substantially below the profit level which could be expected without dumped imports.
(109) The declining situation of the Community industry in the period considered is also confirmed by the reduced production and production capacity, the decrease of wages and employment, return on investment, cash flow and a lack of growth despite reducing average prices by 11 %.
(110) The above negative developments occurred at a time of rather stable productivity, increased investments and improved capacity utilisation. Developments in respect of stocks and ability to raise capital were not considered meaningful for the reasons explained above.
(111) Bearing in mind all these indicators, it is provisionally concluded that the Community industry has suffered material injury during the IP within the meaning of Article 3 of the basic Regulation.
(112) It was also examined whether there is a causal link between the dumped imports from the PRC and the injury suffered by the Community industry. Known factors other than the dumped imports, which could at the same time have injured the Community industry, were also examined to ensure that the possible injury caused by these other factors was not attributed to the dumped imports.
2. Impact of the imports from the PRC
(113) It is recalled that import volumes from the PRC increased by around 150 % and their market share increased by 118 % during the period considered. In addition, as has been explained at recital 85, import prices from the PRC fell by 22 % and substantial price undercutting was taking place (see recital 87). The Community industry reacted to these imports by maintaining its sales volume (in order not to endanger economies of scale) but had to significantly lower its prices. This fall in prices led inter alia to a 55 % fall in profitability. This profitability is well below that expected of this type of industry and is no longer sustainable.
3. Impact of imports from third countries
Indices 2001 = 100 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP |
Non-Chinese imports | 100 | 90 | 140 | 141 |
(114) It is very unlikely that imports originating in other third countries, such as the Republic of Korea and Brazil could have contributed to the injury suffered by the Community industry. The market share of non-Chinese imports in the IP was only at around 3 %. In addition, the average prices of imports from the Republic of Korea and Brazil (i.e. countries from which the largest volumes of non-Chinese imports originated) were 25 % and 47 % higher than those originating in the PRC. It can be concluded, therefore, from their market share and their relatively high price levels that their contribution to the injury suffered could only have been a minor one, if any.
4. Impact of competition between Community producers and overcapacity
(115) Some interested parties claimed that overcapacity within the Community refractory industry had forced the Community industry to compete by reducing prices to an injurious level. However, the capacity utilisation levels identified by the investigation and shown in indexed form at recital 90 over the period considered did not support this argument of overcapacity. Rather, it showed capacity levels resembling those of the steel industry and other similar industries. Whilst it is clear that capacities have been reduced and prices have fallen, this has, in major part, been a response to the increased dumped imports from the PRC. The Commission notes also that the major restructuring of the Community refractory industry had already taken place in the late 1990s.
5. Impact of developments within the steel industry
(116) It was alleged that the technical progress resulting in longer lasting bricks and an efficient steel making process were causing the injury suffered by the Community industry. During the investigation it was pointed out by various steelmakers that due to technical progress, consumption of magnesia bricks per tonne of steel produced had decreased.
| 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP |
EU-25 Steel production (kilotonnes) | 180531 | 180758 | 183441 | 185197 |
EU-25 Consumption of magnesia bricks in (tonnes) | 399563 | 397203 | 401499 | 400638 |
Use of bricks in steel (tonnes per kilotonne) | 2,21 | 2,20 | 2,19 | 2,16 |
The above table shows that the magnesia bricks use in steel was only around 2 %. A fall of this small magnitude would not explain the reductions in sales prices and profitability, as explained above in the section on injury. Therefore, it is considered that the effects of the better technical quality of the bricks could not have been a significant cause of the injury suffered by the Community industry.
(117) It was found during the investigation that some steel producers continue to produce some magnesia bricks themselves. No indication has, however, been found that this practice has increased over the period. Furthermore, as no steel company cooperated as a magnesia bricks producer, it was clear that this sector of production had no effect on the Community industry’s economic situation.
6. Impact of currency changes
(118) Another factor which is claimed to have caused the injury is the currency exchange rate of the dollar against the euro. This is potentially important since the Chinese renminbi has been pegged to the dollar for many years and it is argued that fluctuations in dollar/euro rates have made it more attractive for Chinese producers to export to the Community.
(119) However, the fall of the dollar compared to the euro has not always coincided with the increases in imports. The exchange rate fall began in June 2002 whereas imports started to increase significantly in 2001. Furthermore, it should be stated that freight rates from the PRC to the Community have increased considerably over the period considered. If imports from the PRC were increasing simply because exchange rate fluctuations had created better market conditions, then it could also be expected that imports would fall, or at least stabilise, if such currency fluctuations have been compensated by increased freight rates. While this compensation indeed took place (during the final 15 months of the period considered freight rates increased by around 25 % (source P%amp%O Nedlloyd)), imports have nevertheless continued to increase.
(120) Therefore, it is provisionally concluded that the impact of currency changes can hardly have contributed to the injury suffered by the Community industry.
7. Impact of imports to the Community by the Community industry
(121) Some interested parties also claimed that injury was self-inflicted because the Community industry also imported the product concerned from the PRC. It is recalled that RHI, which is included in the Community industry, imported 5 % of its total Community sales volume from the PRC during the IP. However, the import share and the price difference for these imports compared to the Community sales are relatively small and could not have had a major impact on the market.
8. Impact of exports by the Community industry
(122) During the IP around 27 % of Community industry production volume was exported outside the Community. The volume of exports fell only slightly over the period. However, the profitability of these exports was higher than the sales on the Community market and could not be said to have had any negative impact on the injury suffered by the Community industry.
9. Conclusion on causation
(123) It should be recalled that the injury in this case is primarily price depression causing reduced profitability. Bearing in mind that the rapidly increasing imports from the PRC undercut substantially the Community industry prices, there is no indication that the abovementioned other factors could have been a significant cause of the material injury suffered by the Community industry. No further other factors have been found in the course of the investigation that could have caused material injury.
(124) Based on the above analysis of the effects of all known factors on the situation of the Community industry, it is provisionally concluded that there is a causal link between the dumped imports from the PRC and the material injury suffered by the Community industry.
(125) It has been examined whether compelling reasons exist that could lead to the conclusion that it would not be in the Community interest to impose anti-dumping duties against imports from the country concerned. The Commission sent questionnaires to importers, industrial users and suppliers. Questionnaire replies were received from 14 users, five suppliers and three unrelated importers.
(126) On the basis of the information received from the cooperating parties, the following conclusions are reached.
2. Interest of the Community industry
(127) It is recalled that the Community industry consisted of four producers which employ around 800 staff for the production and sales of the product concerned. It is also recalled that the economic indicators of the Community industry above showed deteriorating financial results during the period considered. Despite the slight improvement during the IP, the Community industry could not reach a satisfying financial situation due to dumped imports from the PRC.
(128) If measures were not imposed it is clear that more and more production in the Community will be closed and that steel companies will be forced to rely much more heavily on Chinese production. There are few production sites around the world currently and the vast majority of raw materials (especially magnesium oxide) are located in the PRC. Therefore, there are no large-scale sources of supply in other third countries. On the other hand, based on the above, the Community industry would obviously benefit from the adoption of anti-dumping measures.
(129) It is, therefore, provisionally concluded that anti-dumping measures would be in the interest of the Community industry.
3. Interest of unrelated importers
(130) Four companies completed the questionnaire for unrelated importers, although only two of these imported the product concerned during the IP. The cooperating importers opposed the imposition of measures and claimed that there were only a few large refractory producers in the Community and that the imports of Chinese bricks had enhanced competition on the Community market. Should measures be imposed and prices raised, Chinese companies may reduce sales to the Community and the importers would suffer losses through reduced trading and reduced profitability.
(131) One importer argued that they may have to close down their businesses employing eight staff, as the product concerned represents a major proportion of their business. However, the purpose of the anti-dumping measures is neither to prohibit imports nor to hamper the activities of the importers in the Community. As the proposed measures affect only a relatively small proportion of the Community steel industry’s total costs and there are existing business relationships established between Chinese exporting producers and the Community users based on specific technical requirements, it is likely that the traditional business of the importers will continue even if anti-dumping measures against dumped imports are imposed.
(132) Furthermore, it was found that the other importer could suffer no substantial consequences if measures were imposed since the product concerned comprises much less than 1 % of total company turnover.
4. Interest of suppliers
(133) The suppliers which cooperated in the investigation supported the proceeding. Two companies, which had been supplying Community industry with the main raw material for magnesia bricks, dead burned magnesite, claimed that they had to stop supplying the refractory industry some years ago because Chinese raw material and, later on, Chinese magnesia bricks entered the market.
5. Interest of users
(134) 14 user companies, i.e. steel producers, submitted questionnaire responses and a further producer and Wirtschaftsvereinigung Stahl (the German Steel Association) made submissions. One further user expressed support for the Community industry’s complaint but all other steel companies opposed the imposition of anti-dumping measures. In total, the user companies represented about 38 % of Community magnesia brick consumption.
5.2. Highly sensitive product
(135) Refractories are a strategically very important material for the steel industry. All the steel they produce passes through the converters, furnaces and ladles which are lined with magnesia bricks. The consequence of refractory failure could, therefore, have material repercussions in terms of interrupted production, repairs and safety. Therefore, high quality, i.e. long lasting bricks, and good technical support is a very important factor for this kind of product. Because of these high technical requirements, it takes a long time, high investments and research to build a supplier relationship. Also the change from one Chinese producer to another producer would be very difficult. The steel producers claim that they have made good progress in the last two years with Chinese producers and their importers in the Community, especially because efficiency was improved and innovations have been made.
(136) The opposing companies consequently fear that there would be a serious risk of shortage of high quality bricks with adequate technical support. They fear that Chinese producers would disappear from the Community market if measures were imposed. In addition, the main reserves of magnesite, which is the main raw material of magnesia bricks, are situated in the PRC. The steel industry is therefore afraid that their relations with Chinese raw material suppliers might be impaired.
(137) As stated earlier, the purpose of the anti-dumping measures is neither to prohibit imports nor to hamper the activities of the steel producers. Consequently, non-injurious imports could still enter the Community market. Therefore, established relationships with Chinese exporters could be continued even if anti-dumping measures against dumped imports are imposed. This is confirmed by the fact that the product concerned only represents an insignificant part in the total cost of production of steel producers, so that the impact of measures on the costs of users is negligible (see below recital 143).
(138) It should also be pointed out that the product concerned is of strategic importance for the steel industry. If measures are not imposed, there is a risk of a transfer of the production of the product concerned to the PRC in the long-term. Bearing in mind the lack of important producers in other third countries, such a reliance on Chinese imports is clearly not a viable scenario for the steel industry.
(139) Furthermore, there is no substantiated evidence concerning a possible impact on access to raw material for those steel makers which produce magnesia bricks themselves.
(140) The user industry claimed that measures would strengthen a market structure consisting of few important producers. The users claimed that this situation of a lack of competition developed due to mergers and acquisitions in the refractory industry in the 1990s.
(141) The largest producer on the Community market had around 30 % market share in the IP which is unlikely to be large enough for them to control and dominate the market. This is supported by the fact that imports from the PRC have been able to erode their market share. As outlined above, these imports will in all likelihood continue after the imposition of measures. Furthermore, many smaller companies produce magnesia bricks in the Community, including some steel companies themselves, and no evidence was provided during the investigation of how the large players on the Community market have dominated the market to the extent claimed. As there was no evidence of any anti-competitive behaviour, the allegation remains unfounded and unsubstantiated.
(142) The steel industry also argued that anti-dumping duties on magnesia bricks would generate additional costs in the highly price sensitive steel market, particularly in respect of competition with steel producers outside the Community. Therefore, anti-dumping duties would have an impact on the steel industry’s competitiveness. Especially, as pressure on the markets for other raw materials for steel products is also very high.
(143) However, the questionnaire responses of the user industry show that the costs for magnesia bricks account for significantly less than 1 % of total costs. Therefore, the proposed anti-dumping duties would have only a marginal influence on the total costs in the steel making process. Furthermore, recent developments in the steel industry clearly show much improved sales prices and profitability, which means that the importance of magnesia bricks in total sales turnover is reduced further.
5.5. Conclusion on users’ interest
(144) Considering the above, it is unlikely that anti-dumping measures would lead to a shortage of supply or to a non-competitive situation on the Community market, in particular, as Chinese magnesia bricks are still likely to retain the current market share. As regards the cost increase, it was found that it would only be marginal and would not materially affect the competitiveness of the steel industry. Therefore, it is provisionally considered that users’ interest is not such as to prohibit the imposition of measures.
6. Conclusion on Community interest
(145) The imposition of measures on imports of magnesia bricks originating in the countries concerned would clearly be in the interest of the Community industry. As regards both the importers/traders and the user industries, any impact on prices of magnesia bricks is expected only to be marginal. In contrast, the losses of market share, price reductions and profitability losses suffered by the Community industry are clearly of greater magnitude.
(146) In view of the above, it is provisionally concluded that there are no compelling reasons not to impose anti-dumping duties on imports of magnesia bricks originating in the PRC.
1. Injury elimination level
(147) In view of the conclusions reached with regard to dumping, injury and Community interest, measures should be imposed in order to prevent further injury being caused to the Community industry by the dumped imports.
(148) The measures should be imposed at a level sufficient to eliminate the injury caused by these imports without exceeding the dumping margin found. When calculating the amount of duty necessary to remove the effects of the injurious dumping, it was considered that any measures should allow the Community industry to cover its costs of production and to obtain overall a profit before tax that could be reasonably achieved by an industry of this type in the sector under normal conditions of competition, i.e. in the absence of dumped imports, on the sales of the like product in the Community. The pre-tax profit margin used for this calculation was 8 % of turnover based on profit levels obtained prior to the existence of dumped imports. On this basis, a non-injurious price was calculated for the Community industry of the like product. The non-injurious price has been obtained by adding the abovementioned profit margin of 8 % to the cost of production.
(149) The necessary price increase was then determined on the basis of a comparison of the weighted average import price with the average non-injurious price. A 10 % allowance was added to the import prices for three reasons. Firstly, the Community industry production sites were located close to steelworks, whereas transport and insurance costs from ports of entry to the Community for imports were usually higher. Secondly, the Community industry included technical support, as part of the purchase price to the relevant steelworks, whereas the exporters usually did not. Thirdly, all sales by the Community industry were at end-user level, whereas many import transactions were at the level of traders which had additional costs.
(150) Any difference resulting from this comparison was then expressed as a percentage of the average import cif value. This comparison was made using groupings of PCN numbers as explained at recital 11.
(151) The provisional weighted average injury margins for companies granted either IT or MET status were:
—Liaoning Mayerton Refractories Co. Ltd | 17,1 % |
—Yingkou Sanhua Refractory Materials Co. Ltd | 42,1 % |

(152) In order to calculate the countrywide injury elimination level for all other exporters in the PRC, it should be recalled that the level of cooperation was low. Therefore, a margin was calculated on the basis of the data of those cooperating exporters, to which neither MET nor IT was granted. As this injury elimination level was found to be lower than the highest injury margin established for the companies listed above and in order to avoid giving an incentive for non-cooperation, the countrywide injury margin was set at the level of the highest margin established above, i.e. 66,1 %.
(153) In the light of the foregoing, it is considered that in accordance with Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation, provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of the product concerned originating in the PRC should be imposed. The anti-dumping duties should be set at the lower of the dumping and injury margins, in accordance with the lesser duty rule. Since the level of cooperation was low, the residual margin should be set at the highest margin calculated for the cooperating exporting producers, i.e. 66,1 % of the cif Community frontier price, duty unpaid. The individual company anti-dumping duty rates specified in this Regulation were established on the basis of the findings of the present investigation. Therefore, they reflect the situation found during that investigation with respect to these companies. These duty rates (as opposed to the countrywide duty applicable to "all other companies") are thus exclusively applicable to imports of products originating in the country concerned and produced by the companies and thus by the specific legal entities mentioned. Imported products produced by any other company not specifically mentioned in the operative part of this Regulation with its name and address, including entities related to those specifically mentioned, cannot benefit from these rates and shall be subject to the duty rate applicable to "all other companies".
[3] forthwith with all relevant information, in particular any modification in the company's activities linked to production, domestic and export sales associated with e.g. that name change or that change in the production and sales entities. If appropriate, the Regulation will accordingly be amended by updating the list of companies benefiting from individual duty rates.
(155) The proposed anti-dumping duties are the following:
Company | Injury elimination margin | Dumping margin | Proposed anti-dumping duty |
Liaoning Mayerton Refractories Co. Ltd | 17,1 % | 11,2 % | 11,2 % |
Yingkou Sanhua Refractory Materials Co. Ltd | 42,1 % | 34,1 % | 34,1 % |

prohibiting fishing for Northern prawns by vessels flying the flag of a Member State other than Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania or Poland
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy [1], and in particular Article 21(3) thereof,
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 27/2005 of 22 December 2004 fixing for 2005 the fishing opportunities and associated fishing conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Community waters and, for Community vessels, in waters where limitations in catch are required, lays down quotas for Northern prawns for 2005 [2].
(2) In order to ensure compliance with the provisions relating to the quantity limits on catches of stocks subject to quotas, the Commission must fix the date by which catches made by vessels flying the flag of a Member State are deemed to have exhausted the quota allocated.
(3) According to the information sent to the Commission, catches of Northern prawns in the waters of the NAFO area 3L by vessels flying the flag of a Member State or registered in a Member State other than Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania or Poland have reached the quota for 2005. The Community has prohibited fishing for this stock from 24 February 2005. This date should be adopted in this Regulation also,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Catches of Northern prawns in the waters of NAFO area 3L by vessels flying the flag of a Member State or registered in a Member State other than Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania or Poland are deemed to have exhausted the quota for 2005.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 558/2005
of 12 April 2005
amending Regulations (EEC) No 3846/87 establishing an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds and (EC) No 174/1999 laying down special detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds in the case of milk and milk products
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in milk and milk products [1], and in particular Article 31(14) thereof,
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 [2], on the basis of the Combined Nomenclature, establishes an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds.
(2) The refund nomenclature provides for cheeses to be eligible for an export refund if they meet minimum requirements as regards milk dry matter and milk fat. A type of cheese produced in some new Member States may meet those necessary requirements but may not benefit from a refund since it is not covered by the present classification system of the export refund nomenclature. Given the importance of that cheese for the dairy industry, trade and milk producers involved, it is appropriate to add a product code under an "other cheeses" position enabling that cheese to be classified under the export refund nomenclature.
(3) The quantities for which export licences are requested in the product category "cheeses" are continually exceeding the profile of the export limits imposed on the Community in the framework of the Agreement on Agriculture following the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations. The additional export licences which will be applied for under the newly created position will further increase the pressure on the category.
(4) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 [3] provides that no refund shall be granted on exports of cheese where the free-at-frontier price prior to application of the refund in the Member State of export is less than EUR 230 per 100 kilograms. Cheese falling within code 0406 90 33 9919 of the nomenclature for refunds is exempt from this provision. It is appropriate in these circumstances and given the high level of demand for export licences for cheeses to apply this provision to all cheeses without exception.
(5) Footnote 10 of Sector 9 of Annex I of Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87, applicable to grated, powdered and processed cheeses, states that added non-lactic matter will not be taken into account for the purpose of calculating the refund. It is appropriate to extend this provision to all cheeses and to better describe the non-lactic matter concerned. It may not be possible for the exporter and even more difficult for the competent authorities to determine the weight of these matters. It is therefore appropriate to reduce the refund by a standard amount.
(6) The refund is granted on the net weight of the cheeses. Some confusion may exist in cases where cheeses are contained in an envelope of paraffin, ash or wax or wrapped in a film of plastic. It is appropriate to provide that such packing are not a part of the net weight of the product for the purpose of calculating the refund. It may not be possible for the exporter and for the competent authorities, as regards the plastic film, the paraffin and the ash, to determine the weight of such materials. It is therefore suitable to reduce the refund by a standard amount.
(7) Regulations (EEC) No 3846/87 and (EC) No 174/1999 should be amended accordingly.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.
In Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 the fourth paragraph is deleted.
This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
It shall apply on export licences applied for from 27 May 2005.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 559/2005
of 12 April 2005
on initiating an investigation concerning the possible circumvention of anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 2074/2004 on imports of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People’s Republic of China by imports of certain ring binder mechanisms consigned from Lao People’s Democratic Republic, whether declared as originating in Lao People’s Democratic Republic or not and making such imports subject to registration
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community [1] (the basic Regulation), and in particular Articles 13(3), 14(3) and 14(5) thereof,
After having consulted the Advisory Committee,
(1) The Commission has received a request pursuant to Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation to investigate the possible circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People’s Republic of China.
(2) The request has been lodged on 28 February 2005 by Ring Alliance Ringbuchtechnik GmbH on behalf of producers representing more than 70 % of the Community production of certain ring binder mechanisms.
(3) The product concerned by the possible circumvention is certain ring binder mechanisms normally declared under CN code ex83051000 originating in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). This CN code is given only for information.
(4) The product under investigation is certain ring binder mechanisms consigned from Lao People’s Democratic Republic (product under investigation) normally declared under the same codes as the product concerned originating in the People’s Republic of China.
(5) The measures currently in force and possibly being circumvented are anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 2074/2004 [2] as extended to imports of the same product consigned from Vietnam [3].
(6) The request contains sufficient prima facie evidence, that the anti-dumping measures on imports of the product concerned originating in the People’s Republic of China are being circumvented by means of transhipment via Lao People’s Democratic Republic and/or by assembly in Lao People’s Democratic Republic of the product under investigation. The evidence submitted is as follows:
- The request shows a significant change in the pattern of trade, as imports of the product under investigation have increased substantially, whereas imports of the product concerned originating in the People’s Republic of China have decreased following the imposition of measures, and that there is insufficient due cause or justification other than the imposition of the duty for such a change.
- This change in the pattern of trade appears to stem from a transhipment of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People's Republic of China via Lao People’s Democratic Republic and/or the assembly of certain ring binder mechanisms in Lao People’s Democratic Republic.
- Furthermore, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping measures on imports of the product concerned originating in the People’s Republic of China are being undermined in terms of quantity and prices. Significant volumes of imports of certain ring binder mechanisms from Lao People’s Democratic Republic appear to have replaced imports of the product concerned originating in the People’s Republic of China.
- Finally, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the prices of the product under investigation are dumped in relation to the normal value previously established for certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People’s Republic of China.
- Should circumvention practices via Lao People’s Democratic Republic covered by Article 13 of the basic Regulation, other than transhipment and assembly, be identified in the course of the investigation, the investigation may cover these practices also.
(7) In light of the above, the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation and to make imports of certain ring binder mechanisms consigned from Lao People’s Democratic Republic, whether declared as originating in Lao People’s Democratic Republic or not, subject to registration, in accordance with Article 14(5) of the Basic Regulation.
(8) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send questionnaires to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in Lao People’s Democratic Republic, to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in the People’s Republic of China, to the importers and to the associations of importers in the Community which cooperated in the investigation that lead to the existing measures or which are listed in the request and to the authorities of the People’s Republic of China and Lao People’s Democratic Republic. Information, as appropriate, may also be sought from the Community industry.
(9) In any event all interested parties should contact the Commission forthwith, but not later than the time limit set in Article 3 in order to find out whether they are listed in the request and, if necessary, request a questionnaire within the time limit set in Article 3(1) of this Regulation, given that the time limit set in Article 3(2) of this Regulation applies to all interested parties.
(10) The authorities of the People’s Republic of China and Lao People’s Democratic Republic will be notified of the initiation of the investigation and provided with a copy of the request.
(b) Collection of information and holding of hearings
(11) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.
(c) Exemption of registration of imports or measures
(12) Since the possible circumvention takes place outside the Community, exemptions may be granted, in accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation, to producers of the product concerned that can show that they are not related to any producer subject to the measures and that are found not to be engaged in circumvention practices as defined in Articles 13(1) and 13(2) of the basic Regulation. Producers wishing to obtain an exemption should submit a request duly supported by evidence within the time limit indicated in Article 3(3) of this Regulation.
(13) Pursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product under investigation should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that, should the investigation result in findings of circumvention, anti-dumping duties of an appropriate amount can be levied retroactively from the date of registration of such imports consigned from Lao People’s Democratic Republic.
(14) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:
- interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information to be taken into account during the investigation,
- producers in Lao People’s Democratic Republic may request exemption from registration of imports or measures,
- interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission.
(15) Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party’s making itself known within the time limits mentioned in Article 3 of this Regulation.
(16) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or otherwise does not provide necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, provisional or final findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.
(17) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made, in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, of facts available. If any interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially, and findings are therefore based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to the party than if it had cooperated,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
An investigation is hereby initiated pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, in order to determine if imports into the Community of certain ring binder mechanisms, falling within CN code ex83051000 (TARIC code 8305100013 and 8305100023), consigned from Lao People’s Democratic Republic, whether declared as originating in Lao People’s Democratic Republic or not, are circumventing the measures imposed by Regulation (EC) No 2074/2004.
For the purpose of this Regulation, ring binder mechanisms shall consist of two rectangular steel sheets or wires with at least four half rings made of steel wire fixed on it and which are kept together by a steel cover. They can be opened either by pulling the half rings or with a small steel-made trigger mechanism fixed to the ring binder mechanism.
The Customs authorities are hereby directed, pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, to take the appropriate steps to register the imports into the Community identified in Article 1 of this Regulation.
Registration shall expire nine months following the date of entry into force of this Regulation.
The Commission, by regulation, may direct Customs authorities to cease registration in respect of imports into the Community of products manufactured by producers having applied for an exemption of registration and having been found not to be circumventing the anti-dumping duties.
1. Questionnaires should be requested from the Commission within 15 days from publication of this Regulation in the Official Journal of the European Union.
2. If their representations are to be taken into account during the investigation, interested parties must make themselves known by contacting the Commission, present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information within 40 days from the date of the publication of this Regulation in the Official Journal of the European Union, unless otherwise specified.
3. Producers in Lao People’s Democratic Republic requesting exemption from registration of imports or measures should submit a request duly supported by evidence within the same 40-day time limit.
4. Interested parties may also apply to be heard by the Commission within the same 40-day time limit.
5. Any information relating to the matter, any request for a hearing or for a questionnaire as well as any request for exemption must be made in writing (not in electronic format, unless otherwise specified), must indicate the name, address, e-mail address, telephone, fax and/or telex numbers of the interested party. All written submission, including the information requested in this Regulation, questionnaire replies and correspondence provided by interested parties on a confidential basis shall be labelled as "Limited" [4] and, in accordance with Article 19(2) of the basic Regulation, shall be accompanied by a non-confidential version, which will be labelled "For inspection by interested parties" and should be sent to the following address:
Fax (32-2) 295 65 05.

Council Regulation (EC) No 560/2005
of 12 April 2005
imposing certain specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities in view of the situation in Côte d'Ivoire
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 60, 301 and 308 thereof,
Having regard to Council Common Position 2004/852/CFSP of 13 December 2004 concerning restrictive measures against Côte d'Ivoire [1],
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament [2],
(1) In Resolution 1572 (2004) of 15 November 2004, the UN Security Council, acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations and deploring the resumption of hostilities in Côte d'Ivoire and the repeated violations of the ceasefire agreement of 3 May 2003, decided to impose certain restrictive measures against Côte d'Ivoire.
(2) Common Position 2004/852/CFSP provides for implementation of the measures set out in UN Security Council Resolution 1572 (2004), including the freezing of funds and economic resources of persons, designated by the competent United Nations Sanctions Committee, who constitute a threat to the peace and national reconciliation process in Côte d'Ivoire, in particular those who block implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis and Accra III Agreements, any other person determined as responsible for serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Côte d'Ivoire on the basis of relevant information, any other person who incites publicly hatred and violence, and any other person determined by the Committee to be in violation of the arms embargo also imposed by Resolution 1572 (2004).
(3) These measures fall within the scope of the Treaty and, therefore, in order to avoid any distortion of competition, Community legislation is necessary to implement them as far as the Community is concerned. For the purpose of this Regulation, the territory of the Community is deemed to encompass the territories of the Member States to which the Treaty is applicable, under the conditions laid down in the Treaty.
(4) In order to ensure that the measures provided for in this Regulation are effective, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication,

1. By way of derogation from Article 2, provided that the competent authorities of the Member States, as listed in Annex II, have notified the Sanctions Committee of their intention to authorise access to such funds and economic resources and have not received a negative decision by the Sanctions Committee within two working days of such notification, they may authorise the release of certain frozen funds or economic resources or the making available of certain frozen funds or economic resources, under such conditions as they deem appropriate, after having determined that the funds or economic resources concerned are:

The Commission and Member States shall immediately inform each other of the measures taken under this Regulation and shall supply each other with any other relevant information at their disposal in connection with this Regulation, in particular information in respect of violation and enforcement problems and judgments handed down by national courts.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 561/2005
of 13 April 2005
establishing the standard import values for determining the entry price of certain fruit and vegetables
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 3223/94 of 21 December 1994 on detailed rules for the application of the import arrangements for fruit and vegetables [1], and in particular Article 4(1) thereof,
(1) Regulation (EC) No 3223/94 lays down, pursuant to the outcome of the Uruguay Round multilateral trade negotiations, the criteria whereby the Commission fixes the standard values for imports from third countries, in respect of the products and periods stipulated in the Annex thereto.
(2) In compliance with the above criteria, the standard import values must be fixed at the levels set out in the Annex to this Regulation,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
The standard import values referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 3223/94 shall be fixed as indicated in the Annex hereto.
This Regulation shall enter into force on 14 April 2005.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 562/2005
of 5 April 2005
laying down rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards communications between the Member States and the Commission in the milk and milk products sector
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products [1], and in particular Article 40 thereof,
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1498/1999 of 8 July 1999 laying down rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards communications between the Member States and the Commission in the milk and milk products sector [2], has been substantially amended several times. Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 and all the regulations laying down rules for the implementation thereof have introduced a number of amendments. For the sake of clarity, Regulation (EC) No 1498/1999 should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new Regulation.
(2) Appraisal of the production and market situation in the milk and milk products sector necessitates a regular exchange of information on the operation of the intervention measures provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999, particularly with regard to changes in stocks of the products concerned, held by intervention agencies and in private storage.
(3) Aid for skimmed milk processed into casein and refunds can be fixed only on the basis of information on changes in prices both on the internal market and in international trade.
(4) The accurate and regular monitoring of trade flows to assess the effect of refunds requires information on exports of products for which refunds are fixed, particularly the quantities awarded under tendering procedures.
(5) The implementation of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations (hereinafter referred to as "the Agreement on Agriculture"), approved by Council Decision 94/800/EC [3] requires a wide range of detailed information to be provided on imports and exports, in particular with regard to licence applications and the way licences are used, in order to ensure compliance with undertakings under the Agreement on Agriculture. Rapid information on export trends is needed in order to make maximum use of those undertakings. Under that Agreement, food aid exports are not subject to the constraints applying to subsidised exports. It should be provided that communications relating to export licence applications must accordingly specify which licence applications cover food aid supplies.
(6) Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 laying down special detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds in the case of milk and milk products [4] lays down special rules for the export of certain milk products to Canada, the United States and the Dominican Republic. Provision should be made for the relevant information to be communicated.
(7) Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 introduces specific arrangements for the grant of refunds on ingredients of Community origin in processed cheese manufactured under the inward processing arrangements. Provision should be made for the relevant information to be communicated.
(8) Under Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999, in certain cases, export licences can be valid for exportation of a product with a code other than that entered in box 16 of the licence. Provision should be made for the relevant information to be communicated.
(9) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 of 14 December 2001 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards the import arrangements for milk and milk products and opening tariff quotas [5], provides for certain import quotas to be administered by means of IMA 1 certificates issued by the authorities of third countries. The Member States inform the Commission of the quantity of products for which import licences are issued on the basis of IMA 1 certificates. Experience has shown that such notification is not always sufficient to allow such imports to be monitored closely at each stage. Provision should be made for additional information to be communicated.
(10) Experience gained over the years in processing the information received by the Commission has shown that it is sometimes communicated on an excessively frequent basis. Therefore, the frequency of some communications has been reduced.
(11) It is essential to be able to compare price quotations for products, particularly for the purposes of calculating refunds and aid amounts. It is also necessary to know how plausible these price quotations are, by weighting the data.
(12) Means of communication have evolved considerably in recent years. Account should be taken of that evolution to make communications more rapid, more efficient and more secure.
(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
1. In the case of intervention measures taken under Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999, Member States shall communicate the following information to the Commission not later than the 10th of each month for the previous month:

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community [1] ("the basic Regulation"), and in particular Article 11(3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
(1) On 5 May 2000, the Commission initiated an anti-dumping proceeding [2] on imports of certain iron or steel ropes and cables originating, inter alia, in Turkey.
(2) This proceeding ultimately resulted in a definitive anti-dumping duty being imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1601/2001 [3] in order to eliminate the injurious effects of dumping.
B. REQUEST FOR AN INTERIM REVIEW
(3) A request for a partial interim review of Regulation (EC) No 1601/2001 was received from Has Çelik ve Halat Sanayi Ticaret A.S. ("Has Çelik", or "the applicant"), a Turkish exporting producer of certain iron or steel ropes and cables subject to the anti-dumping measures in force.
(4) In this request pursuant to Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation it was claimed that the circumstances with regard to dumping on the basis of which the measures in force were established have changed and that these changes are of a lasting nature.
(5) According to the request, the applicant has undergone structural changes which have had a significant impact on the normal value. Furthermore, it was claimed that a comparison of normal value based on its costs or domestic prices and export prices to the Community would lead to a reduction of dumping significantly below the level of the current measures applying to imports from the applicant, i.e. 17,8 %. Therefore, the continued imposition of measures at the existing levels, which were based on the level of dumping previously established, would no longer be necessary to offset dumping.
(6) Having determined, after consulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient evidence existed for the initiation of a partial interim review, the Commission published a notice ("Notice of Initiation") [4] and commenced an investigation, limited in scope to the examination of dumping by the applicant.
(7) The Commission officially advised the representatives of the exporting country and the applicant of the initiation of the partial interim review and gave all the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing. A submission was received from EWRIS, the Liaison Committee of E.U. Wire Rope Industries which was the complainant in the original case.
(8) The Commission also sent a questionnaire to the applicant, which replied within the time limits set in the Notice of Initiation.
(9) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of a determination of dumping and carried out a verification visit at the premises of the applicant.
(10) The investigation of dumping covered the period from 1 July 2003 to 29 February 2004 ("the investigation period").
(11) The product concerned is the same as in the investigation which lead to the imposition of the existing measures ("the previous investigation"), i.e. iron or steel ropes and cables, including locked coil ropes, excluding ropes and cables of stainless steel, with a maximum cross-sectional dimension exceeding 3 mm, with fittings attached or not ("steel wire ropes" or "SWR"), originating in Turkey, currently classifiable within CN codes 73121082, 73121084, 73121086, 73121088 and 73121099.
(12) As in the previous investigation, this investigation has shown that the SWR produced in Turkey by the applicant and sold on the Turkish market or exported to the Community have the same basic physical characteristics and the same uses, and therefore are to be considered a like product within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation.
(13) As far as the determination of normal value is concerned, it was first established whether the applicant's total domestic sales of the like product were representative in comparison with its total export sales to the Community. In accordance with Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation this was found to be the case since its domestic sales volume constituted at least 5 % of its total export sales volume to the Community.
(14) For each of the types sold by the applicant on its domestic market and found to be directly comparable to the types exported to the Community, it was examined whether domestic sales were sufficiently representative for the purposes of Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation. This was considered to be the case when, during the investigation period, the total domestic sales volume of a type represented 5 % or more of the total sales volume of the same type exported to the Community. For most of the types exported to the Community during the investigation period a comparable representative type sold on the domestic market was found.
(15) For the product types meeting the 5 % test, an examination was then made as to whether the domestic sales of each comparable type could be regarded as having been made in the ordinary course of trade, by establishing the proportion of sales to independent customers of the type in question not made at a loss. In all cases, sales of a type not made at a loss represented more than 80 % of the total domestic sales volume of that type and, therefore, normal value was based on a weighted average price of all domestic sales made during the investigation period.
(16) For the product types exported to the Community where no comparable types sold on the domestic market were found, normal value was constructed on the basis of the costs of manufacturing incurred by the applicant for the exported product types in question plus a reasonable amount for selling, general and administrative costs and profits in accordance with Article 2(3) and 2(6) of the basic Regulation. The general and administrative costs were based on the applicant's domestic sales of the like product. The profit margin was based on the applicant's domestic sales of the like product made in the ordinary course of trade.
(17) Since all export sales of the product concerned were made directly to independent customers in the Community, the export price was established on the basis of such prices paid or payable, in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation.
(18) The comparison of normal value with export price was made on an ex-factory basis and at the same level of trade. For the purpose of ensuring a fair comparison, account was taken, in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation, of differences in factors which were claimed and demonstrated to affect prices and price comparability, i.e. transport costs, insurance costs, handling, loading and ancillary costs, credit costs and commissions.
(19) The comparison was made between the weighted average adjusted normal value per product type and the weighted average net ex-works export price for the comparable product type, in accordance with Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation.
(20) The comparison as described above did not show the existence of any dumping.
F. LASTING NATURE OF CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES
(21) In accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation, it was also examined whether the changed circumstances could reasonably be said to be of a lasting nature.
(22) In this respect, the investigation revealed that the applicant has undergone structural changes affecting considerably the production structure and organisation, resulting in a substantially higher production efficiency that led to a drop in production costs and thus reduced normal value as compared to the investigation period used in the previous investigation ( 1 April 1999 until 31 March 2000). During the same period, export prices have increased and no reason was found to indicate that this increase was temporary.
(23) It is consequently concluded that the changed circumstances, in particular the increase in export prices to the Community combined with a substantial decrease in production costs, are of a lasting nature.
(24) In the absence of dumping, it is therefore considered appropriate to repeal the measures insofar as they concern the applicant.
(25) The interested parties were informed of the facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to recommend an amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1601/2001 and were given an opportunity to comment.
(26) Subsequently, EWRIS submitted some general comments relating mainly to increasing prices of raw materials after the investigation period. EWRIS did not put in question the findings concerning dumping as outlined above, but nevertheless expressed concern about the possibility that the applicant may resume dumping in the future.
(27) Concerning the prices of raw materials, it is noted that the prices of raw materials may have increased after the investigation period, but this could not have been taken into account in the dumping calculation for the applicant. In this case, the main raw material is wire rod, a basic steel product, which is a commodity with prices normally fluctuating within short periods. Therefore, any price increase of such raw material cannot be considered to be of a lasting nature, which could put into question the above findings.
(28) Finally, it should be noted that, since the repeal of the measures concerns only the applicant, and not Turkey as a whole, the applicant remains subject to the proceeding and may be reinvestigated in any subsequent review carried out for Turkey pursuant to Article 11(6) of the basic Regulation,

amending Regulation (EC) No 1159/2003 laying down detailed rules of application for the 2003/04, 2004/05 and 2005/06 marketing years for the import of cane sugar under certain tariff quotas and preferential agreements and amending Regulations (EC) No 1464/95 and (EC) No 779/96
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector [1], and in particular Articles 22(2) and 39(6) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1095/96 of 18 June 1996 on the implementation of the concessions set out in Schedule CXL drawn up in the wake of the conclusion of the GATT XXIV.6 negotiations [2], and in particular Article 1 thereof,
(1) Experience gained during the 2003/04 marketing year, which was the first period of application of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1159/2003 [3], has shown that the common detailed rules of application laid down by that Regulation need to be improved, in particular as regards the method of determining the quantities of the delivery obligations for ACP-India preferential sugar.
(2) To guarantee the predictability required for the smooth running of commercial transactions the Commission, before the start of the delivery period concerned, should provisionally determine the quantities of the delivery obligations in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 42(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001.
(3) During the delivery period, once more details are known about the quantities actually delivered in the previous years, these quantities should be fixed subject to possible amendment when the exact figures are available. Without prejudice to investigations to be carried out, a method should also be adopted to process, when determining the quantities of the delivery obligations, the nominal quantities of import licences for which it has not been possible to establish the actual import into the Community.
(4) Regulation (EC) No 1159/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,

The delivery obligations taken into account for the issue of licences as referred to in Article 4 shall be equal to the quantities determined under the first paragraph hereto, adjusted, if necessary, in line with the decisions taken under Articles 3 and 7 of the ACP Protocol and of the Agreement with India.
3. The quantities of delivery obligations shall be determined in accordance with Articles 3 and 7 of the ACP Protocol, Articles 3 and 7 of the Agreement with India, and Articles 11 and 12 of this Regulation, taking into account in particular:
(a) the deliveries actually recorded over the preceding delivery periods;
(b) the quantities declared as quantities which could not be delivered, in accordance with Article 7 of the ACP Protocol and of the Agreement with India.
Where the nominal quantities for which import licences have been issued exceed the quantities of deliveries actually recorded in the previous delivery periods, without prejudice to the results of the investigations to be carried out by the competent authorities, the nominal quantities of the licences for which it has not been possible to establish the actual import into the Community shall be added to the quantities referred to in point (a) of the first paragraph.
4. The adjustments referred to in paragraph 2(c) may comprise transfers of quantities between two consecutive delivery periods provided that this does not disrupt the supply arrangements referred to in Article 39 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001.

of 14 April 2005
establishing a transitional measure for the 2004/2005 marketing year on funding the storage of cereals offered for intervention in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to the Treaty of Accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 41 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals [1],
(1) At the request of certain Member States, Commission Regulation (EC) No 495/2005 [2] extends by three months, for the 2004/2005 marketing year, the deadline for delivering cereals offered for intervention in the Member States which joined the European Community on 1 May 2004, although it does not authorise delivery beyond 31 July 2005.
(2) This measure may give rise to additional storage costs for cereals delivered by this new deadline but after the time-limit initially laid down in the third subparagraph of Article 4(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 824/2000 of 19 April 2000 establishing procedures for the taking-over of cereals by intervention agencies and laying down methods of analysis for determining the quality of cereals [3].
(3) In accordance with Article 6 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78 of 2 August 1978 laying down general rules for the financing of interventions by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section [4], the EAGGF Guarantee Section covers expenditure on the physical operations involved in storage. Member State expenditure on the reimbursement of any additional storage costs, as referred to above, should be treated as expenditure arising from storage costs normally borne by the intervention agencies, and provision should be made for that expenditure to be funded by the EAGGF Guarantee Section on the basis of the same standard amount, account also being taken of the monthly increase added to the intervention price, as provided for in Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003.
(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the EAGGF Committee,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Where the cereals offered for intervention in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia have been effectively taken over by the intervention agency after the deadline laid down in the third subparagraph of Article 4(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 824/2000, Member State expenditure in respect of storage costs incurred between that deadline and the date of actual delivery to the warehouse designated in the delivery schedule, which must be before the deadline laid down in Regulation (EC) No 495/2005, shall be treated as expenditure of the type referred to in Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78.
The standard amount referred to in the first paragraph of Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78 shall be calculated on the basis of the standard amount reimbursed by the Community to the Member States for the storage of cereals purchased for intervention during the 2004/05 marketing year, as laid down in the Commission Decision of 8 October 2004 [5], i.e. EUR 1,26 per tonne per month, from which shall be deducted the monthly increase provided for in Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003, i.e. EUR 0,46 per tonne per month, which has been added to the intervention price for each month after the deadline laid down in the third subparagraph of Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 824/2000.
Such expenditure shall be taken into account in the context of the annual expenditure referred to in Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3492/90 [6] as expenditure on the physical operations involved in the buying-in of products by intervention agencies.
This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
It shall apply to the 2004/2005 marketing year.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

amending Regulation (EC) No 118/2005 as regards the fixing of budgetary ceilings for direct payments to be granted under Article 71 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001, (EC) No 1454/2001, (EC) No 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) No 1254/1999, (EC) No 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/2001 [1], and in particular Article 71(2) thereof,
(1) Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 118/2005 modifying Annex VIII to Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and establishing budgetary ceilings for partial or optional implementation of the Single Payment Scheme and annual financial envelopes for Single Area Payment Scheme provided for in that Regulation establishes, for the 2005 financial year, budgetary ceilings for direct payments to be granted under Article 71 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.
(2) In calculating single payment entitlements France recently discovered a not inconsiderable disparity between the financial result using the individual physical data relating to the different direct payments during the reference period, which are used to establish the reference amounts, and the data which had been communicated by France and used to establish the budgetary ceilings for the various direct payments in Regulation (EC) No 118/2005.
(3) The budgetary ceilings applicable in France for the year 2005 for the direct payments fixed in Regulation (EC) No 118/2005 should therefore be amended.
(4) Regulation (EC) No 118/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Direct Payments,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 118/2005 is hereby replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.
This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 571/2005
of 14 April 2005
fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for molasses in the sugar sector applicable from 15 April 2005
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sugar [1], and in particular Article 24(4) thereof,
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 of 23 June 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for imports of molasses in the sugar sector and amending Regulation (EEC) No 785/68 [2], stipulates that the cif import price for molasses established in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 785/68 [3], is to be considered the representative price. That price is fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(2) For the purpose of fixing the representative prices, account must be taken of all the information provided for in Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68, except in the cases provided for in Article 4 of that Regulation and those prices should be fixed, where appropriate, in accordance with the method provided for in Article 7 of that Regulation.
(3) Prices not referring to the standard quality should be adjusted upwards or downwards, according to the quality of the molasses offered, in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(4) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product concerned and the representative price, additional import duties should be fixed under the terms laid down in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95, specific amounts for these duties should be fixed.
(5) The representative prices and additional import duties for the products concerned should be fixed in accordance with Articles 1(2) and 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95.
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Commission Regulation (EC) No 572/2005
of 14 April 2005
fixing the export refunds on white sugar and raw sugar exported in its unaltered state
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector [1], and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of that Regulation. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector [2]. The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(5) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(6) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial.
(8) To prevent any abuse through the re-import into the Community of sugar products in receipt of an export refund, no refund should be set for all the countries of the western Balkans for the products covered by this Regulation.
(9) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar, and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market, refunds should be set at the appropriate amounts.
(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
The export refunds on the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, undenatured and exported in the natural state, are hereby fixed to the amounts shown in the Annex hereto.
This Regulation shall enter into force on 15 April 2005.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 573/2005
of 14 April 2005

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products [1], and in particular Article 31(3) thereof,
(1) Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund within the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when the refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation, exported in the natural state, are being fixed, account must be taken of:
- the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of milk and milk products on the Community market and prices for milk and milk products in international trade,
- marketing costs and the most favourable transport charges from Community markets to ports or other points of export in the Community, as well as costs incurred in placing the goods on the market of the country of destination,
- the aims of the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products which are to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on this market,
- the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty, and
- the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market, and
- the economic aspect of the proposed exports.
(3) Article 31(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when prices within the Community are being determined account should be taken of the ruling prices which are most favourable for exportation, and that when prices in international trade are being determined particular account should be taken of:
(a) prices ruling on third-country markets;
(b) the most favourable prices in third countries of destination for third-country imports;
(c) producer prices recorded in exporting third countries, account being taken, where appropriate, of subsidies granted by those countries; and
(d) free-at-Community-frontier offer prices.
(4) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation according to destination.
(5) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the list of products on which export refunds are granted and the amount of such refunds should be fixed at least once every four weeks; the amount of the refund may, however, remain at the same level for more than four weeks.
(6) In accordance with Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 on specific detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds on milk and milk products [2], the refund granted for milk products containing added sugar is equal to the sum of the two components; one is intended to take account of the quantity of milk products and is calculated by multiplying the basic amount by the milk products content in the product concerned; the other is intended to take account of the quantity of added sucrose and is calculated by multiplying the sucrose content of the entire product by the basic amount of the refund valid on the day of exportation for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector [3], however, this second component is applied only if the added sucrose has been produced using sugar beet or cane harvested in the Community.
(7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 896/84 [4] laid down additional provisions concerning the granting of refunds on the change from one milk year to another; those provisions provide for the possibility of varying refunds according to the date of manufacture of the products.
(8) For the calculation of the refund for processed cheese provision must be made where casein or caseinates are added for that quantity not to be taken into account.
(9) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in milk and in particular to quotations or prices for milk products within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.
(10) The Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,

Commission Regulation (EC) No 588/2005
of 15 April 2005
amending Regulation (EC) No 1002/2004 accepting undertakings offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of potassium chloride originating in the Republic of Belarus, the Russian Federation or Ukraine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not member of the European Communities [1] (the basic Regulation) and in particular Article 8 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 992/2004 [2] of 17 May 2004 amending Regulation (EEC) No 3068/92 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of potassium chloride originating in Belarus, Russia or Ukraine and in particular Article 1 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
(1) The Council, by Regulation (EEC) No 3068/92 [3], imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of potassium chloride originating, inter alia, in the Russian Federation ("Russia"). By Regulation (EC) No 969/2000 [4], the Council amended and extended the period of application of the measures originally imposed by Regulation (EEC) No 3068/92 on imports of potassium chloride originating, inter alia, in Russia.
(2) In March 2004, by means of a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union [5], the Commission launched, on its own initiative, a partial interim review of the measures in force on imports of potassium chloride from, inter alia, Russia to examine whether they should be amended to take account of the enlargement of the European Union to 25 Member States (Enlargement).
(3) The results of that partial interim review showed that it was in the interests of the Community to provide for the temporary adaptation of the measures so as to avoid a sudden and excessively negative economic impact on importers and users in the 10 new Member States (EU10) immediately following Enlargement.
(4) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 992/2004, authorised the Commission to accept undertaking offers respecting the conditions set out in recitals 27 to 32 of the same Regulation. On this basis, and pursuant to Articles 8, 11(3), 21 and 22(c) of the basic Regulation, the Commission, by Regulation (EC) No 1002/2004 [6], accepted undertaking offers from two exporting producers in Russia.
(5) In the case of one exporting producer, the Commission accepted a joint undertaking for imports of potassium chloride produced by JSC Uralkali, Berezniki, Russia and sold by a trading company, Fertexim Ltd, Limassol, Cyprus which acted as the exclusive distributor for JSC Uralkali’s sales to the Community.
(6) JSC Uralkali has informed the Commission that it would, henceforth, sell to the Community through a different company called Uralkali Trading SA, Geneva, Switzerland. To take account of this change, JSC Uralkali and Fertexim Ltd requested that the relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1002/2004 accepting the joint undertaking be amended. To this end, JSC Uralkali and Uralkali Trading SA have jointly offered a revised undertaking.
(7) JSC Uralkali has also pointed out that the undertaking accepted by Regulation (EC) No 1002/2004 did not allow for direct sales from JSC Uralkali to the first independent customer in the Community. By the revised undertaking, JSC Uralkali also undertakes to respect the terms thereof for direct sales to the Community.
(8) The Commission has examined the undertaking offer. It was concluded that the revised undertaking fulfilled all the necessary criteria for acceptance laid down in Regulation (EC) No 992/2004, namely that: (i) the sales prices of the companies concerned would be at levels which significantly contribute to the elimination of injury; (ii) the companies would observe certain import volumes for sales to customers in the EU10; and (iii) they would also broadly respect their traditional selling patterns to individual customers in the EU10. It was also considered, as had been argued by JSC Uralkali, that the transfer of the trading activities of Fertexim Ltd to Uralkali Trading SA did not affect the workability of the undertaking nor, on the basis of information provided by the companies, its effective monitoring.
(9) Furthermore, the request for exemption of JSC Uralkali’s direct sales to the Community from the anti-dumping duties was considered to be acceptable as it is in line with normal practice to accept appropriate undertaking offers from producers which export directly to the Community.
(10) In light of the above, it was considered appropriate to amend the operative part of Regulation (EC) No 1002/2004 accordingly,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1002/2004 shall be amended as follows:
The undertakings offered by the exporting producers mentioned below, in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of potassium chloride originating in the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation are hereby accepted.
Country | Company | TARIC additional code |
Republic of Belarus | Produced by Republican Unitary Enterprise Production Amalgamation Belaruskali, Soligorsk, Belarus and sold by JSC International Potash Company, Moscow, Russia, or Belurs Handelsgesellschaft mbH, Vienna, Austria, or UAB Baltkalis, Vilnius, Lithuania, to the first independent customer in the Community acting as an importer | A518 |
Russian Federation | Produced by JSC Silvinit, Solikamsk, Russia and sold by JSC International Potash Company, Moscow, Russia, or Belurs Handelsgesellschaft m.b.H, Vienna, Austria to the first independent customer in the Community acting as an importer | A519 |
Russian Federation | Produced and sold by JSC Uralkali, Berezniki, Russia or produced by JSC Uralkali, Berezniki, Russia and sold by Uralkali Trading SA, Geneva, Switzerland to the first customer in the Community acting as an importer | A520" |
This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 70/524/EEC of 23 November 1970 concerning additives in feedingstuffs [1], and in particular Articles 3, 9d(1) and 9e(1) thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition [2] and in particular Article 25 thereof,
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition.
(2) Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 lays down transitional measures for applications for the authorisation of feed additives submitted in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) The applications for authorisation of the additives listed in the Annexes to this Regulation were submitted before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(4) Initial comments on those applications, as provided for in Article 4(4) of Directive 70/524/EEC, were forwarded to the Commission before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003. Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.
(5) The person responsible for putting into circulation Salinomax 120G submitted an application for authorisation for 10 years, as a coccidiostat for chickens for fattening, according to Article 4 of that Directive. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has delivered an opinion on the safety of the use of this preparation for humans, animals and the environment, under the conditions set out in Annex I to this Regulation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation, as specified in Annex I, should be authorised for 10 years.
(6) Data were submitted in support of an application of the new additive Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM 13241 for dogs and cats. The EFSA delivered favourable opinions on 15 April 2004 and 27 October 2004 on the safety for the target animals, the user and the environment. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that micro-organism preparation, as specified in Annex II, should be provisionally authorised.
(7) The use of the micro-organism preparation Enterococcus faecium ATCC 53519 and Enterococcus faecium ATCC 55593 was provisionally authorised, for the first time, for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1436/98 [3]. New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without time limit of that micro-organism preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that micro-organism preparation, as specified in Annex III, should be authorised without a time limit.
(8) The use of the micro-organism preparation Bacillus licheniformis DSM 5749 and Bacillus subtilis DSM 5750 was provisionally authorised, for the first time, for turkeys for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2437/2000 [4] and for calves by Commission Regulation (EC) No 418/2001 [5]. New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without time limit of that micro-organism preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that micro-organism preparation, as specified in Annex III, should be authorised without a time limit.
(9) The use of the micro-organism preparation Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCYC Sc 47 was provisionally authorised, for the first time, for rabbits by the Regulation (EC) No 1436/98. New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without time limit of that micro-organism preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that micro-organism preparation, as specified in Annex III, should be authorised without a time limit.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2286/2002 of 10 December 2002 on the arrangements applicable to agricultural products and goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP States) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1706/98 [2],

Commission Regulation (EC) No 605/2005
of 19 April 2005
amending Regulation (EC) No 296/96 on data to be transmitted by the Member States and the monthly booking of expenditure financed under the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy [1], and in particular Articles 5(3) and 7(5) thereof,
(1) In accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 296/96 [2], the Commission is kept informed at regular intervals of expenditure incurred by the Member States. To avoid unnecessary notifications, provision should be made for this information to be sent every month without affecting the Member States' obligation to keep information drawn up on a weekly basis available to the Commission, so as to allow proper monitoring of expenditure.
(2) Some of the information to be sent by the Member States should be sent electronically in digital form to enable the Commission to use it directly for accounts management. However, forwarding by other means must continue to be possible in justified cases.
(3) To simplify and streamline administrative procedures, simultaneous forwarding of a copy of the information on paper should now only be required for the monthly summaries.
(4) In practice, indicating certain quantities and areas in the detailed declarations submitted by the Member States is of little value for the monthly advances. As a result, that information should no longer be required.
(5) Payments made by the Commission under the budget of the EAGGF Guarantee Section are exclusively in euro. The Member States may choose to make payments to beneficiaries in euro or in their national currency. However, the paying agencies of those Member States not participating in the euro making payments in national currency and in euro must keep separate accounts for the two currencies. To avoid converting these payments twice, the option of declaring amounts paid in euro in national currency should be abolished.
(6) Where, on the basis of the declarations of expenditure received from the Member States, the total amount of advance commitments which could be authorised under Article 150(3) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities [3] is more than half of all corresponding appropriations for the current financial year, the Commission is required to reduce those amounts. For the sake of sound management that reduction must be shared among all the Member States proportionally, on the basis of the declarations of expenditure received from them.
(7) If the Community budget has not been adopted by the beginning of the financial year, the second subparagraph of Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 provides that payments may be made monthly per chapter to a maximum of one twelfth of the allotted appropriations in the chapter in question of the preceding financial year. To allocate the available appropriations fairly among the Member States, provision should be made for advances to be granted in this case as a percentage, laid down for each chapter, of the declarations of expenditure submitted by each Member State and for the balance not used in a given month to be reallocated in Commission decisions on subsequent monthly payments.
(8) As part of the reform of the CAP and the introduction of the single farm payment scheme, Member State compliance with the payment deadlines is vital to the proper application of the rules on financial discipline. Specific rules should therefore be laid down to help avoid, wherever possible, any risk of the annual appropriations available in the Community budget being exceeded.
(9) For reasons of sound administration, where delays arise in sending supporting documents for payments made under Commission Regulation (EC) No 817/2004 of 29 April 2004 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) [4], it must be made possible for payments by the Commission to the Member State relating to September to be held over to the following month.
(10) Half of the expenditure relating to storage operations carried out in September is taken into account in respect of October and the balance in respect of November. To simplify management of the paying agencies' accounts, provision should be made for expenditure on these operations to be taken into account in full (100 %) in respect of October.
(11) Rural development expenditure part-financed by the Community budget and the national budgets is declared at the latest in respect of the second month following payment to the beneficiaries. To harmonise the accounting rules applied in the field of the EAGGF Guarantee Section, provision should be made for this expenditure to be declared in respect of the month in which the payments were made to the beneficiaries.
(12) Regulation (EC) No 296/96 should be amended accordingly.
(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the EAGGF Committee,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Regulation (EC) No 296/96 is hereby amended as follows:
1. Article 3 is amended as follows:
(a) paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 are replaced by the following:

If advance commitments in accordance with Article 150(3) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 [6] exceed one half of the total corresponding appropriations for the current financial year, the advances shall be granted as a percentage of the declarations of expenditure received from each Member State. The Commission shall take the balance of amounts not reimbursed to the Member States into account in decisions on subsequent reimbursements.
If the Community budget has not been adopted by the beginning of the financial year, the advances shall be granted as a percentage of the declarations of expenditure received from each Member State, laid down for each chapter of expenditure and within the limits laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002. The Commission shall take the balance of amounts not reimbursed to the Member States into account in decisions on subsequent reimbursements.
(b) paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:
"2. Advances against booking shall be reduced for expenditure effected after the deadlines laid down as follows:

- where the 4 % threshold referred to in point (a) has not been used in full for payments made no later than 15 October of year n+1 and the remainder of the threshold exceeds 2 %, that remainder shall be reduced to 2 %,
- in any case, payments made in the course of budget year n+2 and subsequent years shall be eligible for the Member State concerned only up to the level of its national ceiling as provided for in Annexes VIII or VIIIa or its annual financial envelope established in accordance with Article 143b(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 for the year preceding that of the budget year during which the payment is made, where applicable plus the amounts relating to the dairy premium and additional payments provided for in Articles 95 and 96 and the additional amount of aid provided for in Article 12 of that Regulation, less the percentage provided for in Article 10 and corrected by the adjustment provided for in Article 11, taking account of Article 12a of that Regulation and the amounts set in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 188/2005 [8],
- above the thresholds referred to above, the expenditure concerned by this point shall be reduced by 100 %;
(d) the Commission shall apply a different time scale and/or lower reductions or none at all if exceptional management conditions are encountered for certain measures or if justified reasons are advanced by the Member States.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 606/2005
of 19 April 2005
amending Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the single payment scheme provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001, (EC) No 1454/2001, (EC) No 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) No 1254/1999, (EC) No 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/2001 [1], and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 51(b) and Article 145(c) and (d) thereof,
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 [2] introduces the implementing rules for the single payment scheme as from 2005. Experience of the administrative and operational implementation of that scheme at national level has shown that in certain respects further detailed rules are needed and in other respects the existing rules need to be clarified and adapted.
(2) Article 24(2) of Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 provides that the beginning of the 10 month period referred to in Article 44(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 for each individual farmer is to be fixed by Member States at a single date within a period to be fixed between 1 September of the calendar year preceding the year of lodging an application under the single payment scheme and 30 April of the following calendar year or is to be left at the farmer’s choice within the fixed period. It is appropriate to allow farmers more flexibility for the fixing of the beginning of the 10 month period at the level of each parcel when specific agriculture conditions so warrant.
(3) Article 51 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 864/2004 [3] and made applicable as from 1 January 2005 by Commission Regulation (EC) No 394/2005, authorises Member States to allow secondary crops to be cultivated on the eligible hectares during a period of maximum three months starting each year on 15 August. It is appropriate to bring forward that date to allow the growing of temporary vegetable crops in regions where cereals are usually harvested sooner for climatic reasons as communicated by the Member States concerned to the Commission.
(4) Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(5) Due to the fact that Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 applies as from 1 January 2005, it is appropriate that the provisions provided for in this Regulation apply retroactively from that date.
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Direct Payments,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 is amended as follows:
1. in Article 24(2) the following subparagraph is added:
"However, where specific agricultural conditions so warrant, Member States may authorise farmers to fix, within the fixed period referred to in the first subparagraph, two different dates for the beginning of the 10 month period in respect of their holding. Farmers who make use of this possibility shall indicate their choices in respect of each individual parcel in their single application form in addition to the information to be given by them in accordance with Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 796/2004."
2. the following Article 28a is inserted:
Three months period provided for in Article 51(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003
The Member States indicated in the Annex are authorised to allow secondary crops to be cultivated on the eligible hectares during a period of maximum three months starting each year on the date laid down in that Annex for each Member State."
3. an Annex as set out in the Annex to this Regulation is added.
This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
It shall apply from 1 January 2005.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
