RESOLVED to this end to eliminate progressively the obstacles to substantially all their trade, in accordance with the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade concerning the establishment of free trade areas,
DECLARING their readiness to examine, in the light of any relevant factor, and in particular of developments in the Community, the possibility of developing and deepening their relations where it would appear to be useful in the interests of their economies to extend them to fields not covered by this Agreement,
HAVE DECIDED, in pursuit of these objectives and considering that no provision of this Agreement may be interpreted as exempting the Contracting Parties from the obligations which are incumbent upon them under other international agreements,
The aim of this Agreement is: (a) to promote through the expansion of reciprocal trade the harmonious development of economic relations between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Iceland and thus to foster in the Community and in Iceland the advance of economic activity, the improvement of living and employment conditions, and increased productivity and financial stability,

(c) to contribute in this way, by the removal of barriers to trade, to the harmonious development and expansion of world trade.

Subsequent reductions shall be made in accordance with the timetable laid down in Article 4 (1).
3. Denmark, Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom may retain until 1 January 1976 a customs duty of a fiscal nature or the fiscal element of a customs duty upon implementation of Article 38 of the "Act concerning the Conditions of Accession and the Adjustments to the Treaties" drawn up and adopted within the Conference between the European Communities and the Kingdom of Denmark, Ireland, the Kingdom of Norway and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

2. In such cases the Contracting Party in question shall take due account of the interests of the other Contracting Party. To this end the Contracting Parties may consult each other within the Joint Committee provided for in Article 30.

3. In such cases the customs offices where the TIR operation is suspended or resumed shall be deemed to be customs offices of exit en route and customs offices of entry en route respectively.
Subject to the provisions of this Convention, and in particular Article 18, another customs office of destination may he substituted for a customs office of destination originally indicated.
On arrival of the load at the customs office of destination, and provided that the goods are then placed under another system of customs control or are cleared for home use, discharge of the TIR carnet shall take place without delay.

1. The provisions of this section apply only to the transport of heavy or bulky goods as defined in Article 1 (k) of this Convention.

The customs administrations of the countries of departure and of destination shall not consider the holder of the TIR carnet responsible for the discrepancies which may be discovered in those countries, when the discrepancies in fact relate to the customs procedures which preceded or followed a TIR operation and in which the holder was not involved.

However, in respect of Agency inspectors needed for the activities provided for in Article 48 and to carry out ad hoc inspections pursuant to Article 71 (a), the designation procedures shall be completed if possible within 30 days after the entry into force of this Agreement. If such designation appears impossible within this time limit, Agency inspectors for such purposes shall be designated on a temporary basis.
The States shall grant or renew as quickly as possible appropriate visas, where required, for each Agency inspector designated pursuant to Article 85.
Conduct and visits of Agency inspectors
Agency inspectors, in exercising their functions under Articles 48 and 71 to 75, shall carry out their activities in a manner designed to avoid hampering or delaying the construction, Commissioning or operation of facilities, or affecting their safety. In particular, Agency inspectors shall not operate any facility themselves or direct the staff of a facility to carry out any operation. If Agency inspectors consider that in pursuance of Articles 74 and 75, particular operations in a facility should be carried out by the operator, they shall make a request therefor.
When Agency inspectors require services available in a State, including the use of equipment in connection with the performance of inspections, the State concerned and the Community shall facilitate the procurement of such services and the use of such equipment by Agency inspectors.
The Community and the States concerned shall have the right to have Agency inspectors accompanied during their inspections by its inspectors and their representatives respectively, provided that Agency inspectors shall not thereby be delayed or otherwise impeded in the exercise of their functions.

The principal repayments of Special Action Credits shall be made payable to the Special Action Account and the amount of the currency of a Member State so repaid shall as soon as practicable thereafter be returned by the administrator to such Member State. The Association shall not be liable for any shortfall in the repayment of Special Action Credits.
Until all Special Action Credits shall have been committed, the administrator shall keep the EEC informed of projects and programmes being prepared for consideration by the executive directors and those which have been approved by the executive directors. During the period of disbursement of Special Action Credits the administrator shall inform the EEC quarterly of the progress of the Special Action Credits and of the disbursements made thereunder. The administrator shall, as soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year of the Association, furnish to the EEC a detailed statement of the Special Action Account, together with an opinion of the Association's own external auditors of such statement. After the Special Action Credits shall have been fully disbursed, the administrator shall as soon as practicable furnish to the EEC a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed from the Special Action Account.
The administrator shall establish and maintain appropriate records and accounts to identify the contributions to the Special Action Account, the commitments to be financed out of the Account, and the receipts and disbursements of funds in the Account and repayments to the Member States.
The EEC and the administrator shall fully cooperate with each other to achieve the purposes of these arrangements. To that end, until the Special Action Account is fully disbursed, the EEC (acting through the Commission of the European Communities) and the administrator shall, from time to time, exchange views on the status and condition of the Special Action Account, on the progress of the programmes or projects financed out of the Special Action Credits, and on all other matters relating to these arrangements.
If this Agreement shall not have become effective by 31 December 1978, or such later date as may be agreed between the EEC and the Association, this Agreement and all obligations of the parties thereunder shall forthwith terminate.
If and when the entire principal amount of all Special Action Credits withdrawn by borrowers thereunder shall have been repaid and returned to the Member States in accordance with Section 8 of Article II of this Agreement, this Agreement and all obligations of the parties thereunder shall forthwith terminate.
This Agreement shall be approved by each Member State and the EEC in accordance with the procedural requirements of each party.
The Government of each Member State shall notify the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities when such procedural requirements applicable to it have been completed. The General Secretariat shall forward such notification, together with a notification that the EEC has duly approved this Agreement, to the Association.

AGREEMENT in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Settlements concerning the mobilization of claims held by the Member States under the medium-term financial assistance arrangements
A. Letter from the Bank for International Settlements
The BIS could conclude stand-by credit agreements with the creditor countries' central banks if they should so request.
These agreements could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid into the mechanism by the creditor country, with an overall limit of 2 725 million units of account, corresponding to half of the total of future commitment ceilings of the member countries.
The practical details of each stand-by agreement would be determined by agreement between the BIS and the central bank in question. However, certain conditions, which the BIS would be prepared to apply, can be indicated already:
The initial commitment of the BIS for each stand-by credit would be for two years with the option of renewal for other periods, the total not to exceed five years.
I should be obliged if you would inform me whether the Council of the European Communities is in agreement with the above.
Please accept, Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration.

PROTOCOL TO THE AGREEMENT ON IMPLEMENTATION OF ARTICLE VII OF THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE
The Parties to the Agreement on implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on tariffs and trade (hereinafter referred to as "the Agreement"),
Having regard to the multilateral trade negotiations and to the desire expressed by the Trade Negotiations Committee at its meeting of 11 and 12 April 1979 to arrive at a single text of an Agreement on implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement of tariffs and trade;
Recognizing that developing countries may have particular problems in applying the Agreement;
Hereby: I 1. Agree to the deletion of the provision of Article 1 (2) (b) (iv) of the Agreement;
2. Recognize that the five-year delay in the application of the provisions of the Agreement by developing countries provided for in Article 21 (1) may, in practice, be insufficient for certain developing countries. In such cases a developing country Party to the Agreement may request before the end of the period referred to in Article 21 (1) an extension of such period, it being understood that the Parties to the Agreement will give sympathetic consideration to such a request in cases where the developing country in question can show good cause;
3. Recognize that developing countries which currently value goods on the basis of officially established minimum values may wish to make a reservation to enable them to retain such values on a limited and transitional basis under such terms and conditions as may be agreed to by the Parties to the Agreement;
4. Recognize that developing countries which consider that the reversal of the sequential order at the request of the importer provided for in Article 4 of the Agreement may give rise to real difficulties for them may wish to make a reservation to Article 4 in the following terms:
"The Government of ... reserves the right to provide that the relevant provision of Article 4 of the Agreement shall apply only when the customs authorities agree to the request to reverse the order of Articles 5 and 6."
If developing countries make such a reservation, the Parties to the Agreement shall consent to it under Article 23 of the Agreement;
5. Recognize that developing countries may wish to make a reservation with respect to Article 5 (2) of the Agreement in the following terms:
"The Government of ... reserves the right to provide that Article 5 (2) of the Agreement shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of the relevant note thereto whether or not the importer so requests."
If developing countries make such a reservation, the Parties to the Agreement shall consent to it under Article 23 of the Agreement;
6. Recognize that certain developing countries have expressed concern that there may be problems in the implementation of Article 1 of the Agreement in so far as it relates to importations into their countries by sole agents, sole distributors and sole concessionaires. The Parties to the Agreement agree that, if such problems arise in practice in developing countries applying the Agreement, a study of this question shall be made, at the request of such countries, with a view to finding appropriate solutions;
7. Agree that Article 17 recognizes that in applying the Agreement, customs administrations may need to make enquiries concerning the truth or accuracy of any statement, document or declaration presented to them for customs valuation purposes. They further agree that the Article thus acknowledges that enquiries may be made which are, for example, aimed at verifying that the elements of value declared or presented to customs in connection with a determination of customs value are complete and correct. They recognize that Parties to the Agreement, subject to their national laws and procedures, have the right to expect the full cooperation of importers in these enquiries;
II 1. Upon the entry into force of the Agreement the provisions of this Protocol shall be deemed to be part of the Agreement.
2. This Protocol shall be deposited with the Director-General to the Contracting Parties to the GATT. It is open for acceptance, by signature or otherwise, by signatories of the Agreement on implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on tariffs and trade and by other governments accepting or acceding to the Agreement pursuant to the provisions of Article 22 thereof.
ARRANGEMENT in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Argentine Republic on trade in mutton and lamb
- frozen mutton, lamb and goatmeat (02.01 A IV b)).
2. Within the terms of this arrangement, the possibilities of export of mutton and lamb and goatmeat from Argentina to the Community are fixed at the following annual quantity : 20 000 tonnes expressed in carcass weight (1).
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the arrangement, Argentina undertakes to implement the appropriate procedures to ensure that the annual quantity actually exported does not exceed the quantity agreed and shall be exported in accordance with the traditional patterns of presentation (frozen or chilled).
Should changes in technology and trade make it possible to modify the presentational structure of trade, the two parties to this arrangement will consult each other prior to any such modification in the Committee mentioned in clause 10 in order to find an adequate solution.
3. Should the Community have recourse to the safeguard clause, it undertakes that Argentina's access into the Community as provided for in this arrangement will not be affected.
4. If imports in any one year exceed the quantities agreed, the Community reserves the right to suspend imports from Argentina for the remainder of that year. The quantity overshipped shall be offset against Argentina's export entitlement for the following year.
5. The Community undertakes to limit the levy applicable to imports of products covered by the present arrangement to a maximum amount of 10 %, ad valorem. (1)Carcass weight (bone-in equivalent weight). By this term is understood the weight of bone-in meat presented as such as well as boned meat converted by a coefficient into bone-in weight. For this purpose 55 kg of boned mutton corresponds to 100 kg of bone-in mutton and 60 kg of boned lamb corresponds to 100 kg of bone-in lamb.
6. At the time of accession of new Member States, the Community, in consultation with Argentina, will alter the quantities set out in paragraph 2, in accordance with Argentina's trade with each new Member State.

8. In taking account of the objectives and provisions of this arrangement the Community agrees that any actual implementation of refunds or any other form of assistance with respect to exports of mutton, lamb and live sheep and lamb intended for slaughter will apply only at prices and on conditions which comply with existing international obligations and in respect of the traditional shares of the Community of world export trade in these products. These words shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article XVI of GATT and in particular in conformity with Article 10 (2) (c) of the Agreement on interpretation and application of Articles VI, XVI and XXIII of the General Agreement on tariffs and trade.
9. Argentina shall ensure that this arrangement is observed, in particular, by issuing export certificates covering the products referred to in paragraph 1 within the limits of the quantities covered by this arrangement.
For its part, the Community shall undertake to adopt all necessary provisions to make the issue of the import certificates for the products referred to above, originating in Argentina, subject to the presentation of an export certificate, issued by the competent authority designated by the Argentine Government.
Detailed rules for applying this system shall be laid down in such a way as to render unnecessary the lodging of a security for the issue of the import certificate in respect of the products in question.
Also, such detailed rules of application shall provide that the competent Argentine authority shall communicate periodically to the competent authority of the Community the quantities in respect of which export certificates are issued, broken down, where appropriate, according to destination.
10. A consultative committee shall be set up composed of representatives from the Community and from Argentina. The Committee shall ensure that the arrangement is being properly applied and is functioning smoothly. It will examine regularly the trend of the two parties' markets in mutton and lamb and goatmeat and the trend of the international market, as well as marketing conditions on those markets including those relevant to the objective set out in clause 7 of this arrangement.
It will ensure that the proper application of the arrangement is not affected by the export of mutton and lamb and goatmeat-based products to the Community under customs headings not referred to by the arrangement.
The Committee will discuss all questions which could arise in applying the arrangement and will recommend appropriate solutions to the competent authorities.
11. The provisions of this arrangement shall be agreed without prejudice to the parties' rights and obligations under GATT.
12. The annual quantity fixed in clause 2 refers to the period running from 1 January to 31 December. The quantity applicable as of the implementation of the present arrangement and until 1 January of the following year will be fixed on a pro rata basis in relation to the total annual quantity and will take into account the seasonality of the trade.
13. This arrangement shall apply, on the one hand, to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and under the conditions laid down in that Treaty and, on the other hand, to the territory of the Argentine Republic.
14. The Agreement shall enter into force on 20 October 1980.
It shall remain in force until 31 March 1984, and shall continue in force thereafter subject to each party having the right to denounce it by giving one year's notice in writing.

13. This arrangement shall apply, on the one hand, to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and under the conditions laid down in that Treaty and, on the other hand, to the territory of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay.
14. The arrangement shall enter into force on 20 October 1980. It shall remain in force until 31 March 1984, and shall continue in force thereafter subject to each party having the right to denounce it by giving one year's notice in writing. In any case the provisions of this arrangement will be examined by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with a view to making any adjustment which they agree is necessary.
I should be obliged if you would kindly confirm the agreement of your Government to the foregoing.
Please accept, Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration.
For the Council of the European Communities
I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of today's date, which reads as follows:
- frozen mutton, lamb and goatmeat (subheading 02.01 A IV b)) of the Common Customs Tariff).
2. Within the terms of this arrangement, the possibilities of export of mutton and lamb and goatmeat from Uruguay to the Community are fixed at the following annual quantity:
5 100 tonnes expressed in carcass weight (1).
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the arrangement, Uruguay undertakes to implement the appropriate procedures to ensure that the annual quantity actually exported does not exceed the quantity agreed and shall be exported in accordance with the traditional patterns of presentation (frozen or chilled).
Should changes in technology and trade make it possible to modify the presentational structure of trade, the two parties to this arrangement will consult each other prior to any such modification in the Committee mentioned in clause 10 in order to find an adequate solution.
3. Should the Community have recourse to the safeguard clause, it undertakes that Uruguay's access to the Community as provided for in this arrangement will not be affected.
4. If imports from Uruguay in any one year exceed the quantities agreed, the Community reserves the right to suspend imports from Uruguay for the remainder of that year. The quantity overshipped shall be offset against Uruguay's export entitlement for the following year.
5. The Community undertakes to limit the levy applicable to imports of products covered by the present arrangement to a maximum amount of 10 %, ad valorem. (1)Carcass weight (bone-in equivalent weight). By this term is understood the weight of bone-in meat presented as such as well as boned meat converted by a coefficient into bone-in weight. For this purpose 55 kg of boned mutton corresponds to 100 kg of bone-in mutton and 60 kg of boned lamb corresponds to 100 kg of bone-in lamb.
6. At the time of accession of new Member States, the Community, in consultation with Uruguay, will alter the quantities set out in clause 2, in accordance with Uruguay's trade with each new Member State. The charges applicable to imports for the said new Member States shall be fixed in accordance with the rules in the Treaty of Accession ; the maximum level of the levy specified in clause 5 of this arrangement being taken into account.
The total quantity as mentioned in clause 2 above is fixed at 5 800 tonnes in carcass weight as from the date of accession of Greece to the Community.
7. The Community will endeavour to avoid any market development which could prejudice the marketing of Uruguay's mutton and lamb on the Community market within the limits of the quantities agreed. In particular, the Community will take steps to ensure that the disposal of intervention stocks in frozen form arising from the operation of the regulation does not undermine such marketing of Uruguay's mutton and lamb.
8. In taking account of the objectives and provisions of this arrangement the Community agrees that any actual implementation of refunds or any other form of assistance with respect to exports of mutton, lamb and live sheep and lambs intended for slaughter will apply only at prices and on conditions which comply with existing international obligations and in respect of the traditional shares of the Community of world export trade in these products. These words shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article XVI of the General Agreement on tariffs and trade and in particular in conformity with Article 10 (2) (c) of the Agreement on interpretation and application of Articles VI, XVI and XXIII of the General Agreement on tariffs and trade.
9. Uruguay shall ensure that this arrangement is observed, in particular, by issuing export certificates covering the products referred to in clause 1 within the limits of the quantities covered by this arrangement.
For its part, the Community shall undertake to adopt all necessary provisions to make the issue of the import certificates for the products referred to above, originating in Uruguay, subject to the presentation of an export certificate, issued by the competent authority designated by the Uruguay Government.
Detailed rules for applying this system shall be laid down in such a way as to render unnecessary the lodging of a security for the issue of the import certificate in respect of the products in question.
Also, such detailed rules of application shall provide that the competent Uruguay authority shall communicate periodically to the competent authority of the Community the quantities in respect of which export certificates are issued, broken down, where appropriate, according to destination.
10. A Consultative Committee shall be set up composed of representatives from the Community and from Uruguay. The Committee shall ensure that the arrangement is being properly applied and is functioning smoothly. It will examine regularly the trend of the two parties' markets in mutton and lamb and goatmeat and the trend of the international market, as well as marketing conditions on those markets including those relevant to the objective set out in clause 7 of this arrangement.
It will ensure that the proper application of the arrangement is not affected by the export of mutton and lamb and goatmeat-based products to the Community under customs headings not referred to by the arrangement.

Contracting Parties to the European Agreement of 15 December 1958 on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin (hereinafter called "the Agreement"),
Having regard to the provisions of Article 5, paragraph 1, of the Agreement, according to which "The Contracting Parties shall take all necessary measures to exempt from all import duties the therapeutic substances of human origin placed at their disposal by the other Parties';
Considering that so far as the Member States of the European Economic Community are concerned, the undertaking to grant this exemption falls within the competence of the Community, which possesses the necessary powers in this respect by virtue of the treaty which instituted it;
Considering therefore that for the purpose of the implementation of Article 5, paragraph 1, of the Agreement, it is necessary for the European Economic Community to be able to become a Contracting Party to the Agreement,
The European Economic Community may become a Contracting Party to the Agreement by signing it. In respect of the Community, the Agreement shall enter into force on the first day of the month following such signature.
1. This Additional Protocol shall be open for acceptance by the Contracting Parties to the Agreement. It shall enter into force on the first day of the month following the date on which the last of the Contracting Parties has deposited its instrument of acceptance with the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.
2. However, this Additional Protocol shall enter into force on the expiration of a period of two years from the date on which it has been opened for acceptance, unless one of the Contracting Parties has notified an objection to the entry into force. If such an objection has been notified, paragraph 1 of this Article shall apply.
From the date of its entry into force, this Additional Protocol shall form an integral part of the Agreement. From that date, no State may become a Contracting Party to the Agreement without at the same time becoming a Contracting Party to the Additional Protocol.
The Secretary-General of the Council of Europe shall notify the member States of the Council of Europe, any State having acceded to the Agreement and the European Economic Community of any acceptance or objection made under Article 2 and of the date of entry into force of this Additional Protocol in accordance with Article 2.
The Secretary-General shall also notify the European Economic Community of any act, notification or communication relating to the Agreement.
EUROPEAN AGREEMENT on the Exchange of Blood-grouping Reagents
THE SIGNATORY GOVERNMENTS OF THE MEMBER STATES OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE,
Considering that blood-grouping reagents are not available in unlimited quantities;
Considering that it is most desirable that member countries, in a spirit of European solidarity, should assist one another in the supply of these blood-grouping reagents, should the need arise;
Considering that such mutual assistance is only possible if the character and use of such blood-grouping reagents are subject to rules laid down jointly by the member countries and if the necessary import facilities and exemptions are granted,
For the purposes of this Agreement, the expression "blood-grouping reagents" refers to reagents of human, animal and plant and other origin, used for blood-grouping and for the detection of blood incompatibilities.
Any Contracting Party may, by a declaration addressed to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, when signing this Agreement or depositing its instrument of ratification or approval, or accession, limit the application of this Agreement to blood-grouping reagents of human origin. This declaration may be withdrawn at any time, by notification addressed to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.
The Contracting Parties undertake, provided that they have sufficient stocks for their own needs, to make blood-grouping reagents available to other Parties who are in urgent need of them and to charge only those costs of collection, processing and carriage of such substances and the cost (if any) of their purchase.
Blood-grouping reagents shall be made available to the other Contracting Parties subject to the condition that no profit is made on them, that they shall be used solely for medical purposes and shall be delivered only to bodies designated by the Government concerned.
The Contracting Parties shall certify that the provisions as laid down in the Protocol to this Agreement have been observed.
They shall also comply with any rules to which they have subscribed with regard to international standardization in this field.
All consignments of blood-grouping reagents shall be accompanied by a certificate to the effect that they were prepared in accordance with the specifications in the Protocol. This certificate shall be based on the model to be found in the Annex to the Protocol.
The Protocol and its Annex constitute an administrative arrangement and may be amended or supplemented by the Governments of the Parties to this Agreement.
The Contracting Parties shall take all necessary measures to exempt from all import duties the blood-grouping reagents placed at their disposal by the other Parties.
They shall also take all necessary measures to provide for the speedy delivery of these substances, by the most direct route, to the consignees referred to in Article 3 of this Agreement.
The Contracting Parties shall forward to one another, through the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, a list of the bodies empowered to issue certificates as provided in Article 4 of this Agreement.
They shall also forward a list of bodies empowered to distribute imported blood-grouping reagents. Wherever possible these bodies should be the same as those referred to in Article 6 of the European Agreement on the Exchange of Therapeutic Substances of Human Origin.
The present Agreement shall be open to the signature of Members of the Council of Europe, who may become Parties to it either by: (a) signature without reservation in respect of ratification or approval ; or
(b) signature with reservation in respect of ratification or approval, followed by ratification or approval.
Instruments of ratification or approval shall be deposited with the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.
The present Agreement shall enter into force one month after the date on which three Members of the Council shall, in accordance with Article 7, have signed the Agreement without reservation in respect of ratification or approval or shall have ratified or approved it.
In the case of any Member of the Council who shall subsequently sign the Agreement without reservation in respect of ratification or approval or who shall ratify or approve it, the Agreement shall enter into force one month after the date of such signature or the date of deposit of the instrument of ratification or approval.
After the entry into force of this Agreement, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe may invite any non-member State to accede to the present Agreement. Such accession shall take effect one month after the date of deposit of the instrument of accession with the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.
The Secretary-General of the Council of Europe shall notify Members of the Council and acceding States: (a) of the date of entry into force of this Agreement and of the names of any Members who have signed without reservation in respect of ratification or approval or who have ratified or approved it;
(b) of the deposit of any instrument of accession in accordance with Article 9;
(c) of any declaration or notification received in accordance with the provisions of Article 1, paragraph 2;
(d) of any notification received in accordance with Article 11 and its effective date;
(e) of any amendment of the Protocol and of its Annex under Article 4, paragraph 4.
The present Agreement shall remain in force indefinitely.
Any Contracting Party may terminate its own application of the Agreement by giving one year's notice to that effect to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.
PROTOCOL TO THE EUROPEAN AGREEMENT on the Exchange of Blood-grouping Reagents
A blood-grouping (1) reagent must react with all blood samples tested which contain the antigen homologous to the antibody or other substance mentioned on the label.
When a reagent is used according to the technique recommended by the producer there must be no evidence of any of the following factors or phenomena: (a) haemolytic properties;
(b) antibodies or other substances besides those mentioned on the label;
(c) bacterial products liable to cause false positive or false negative reactions;
(d) pseudo-agglutination through the formation of rouleaux;
Titre is measured by making successive two-fold dilutions of the reagent under study in an appropriate medium. To each dilution is added an equal volume of a suspension of red corpuscles. The titre is the reciprocal of the figure representing the highest serum dilution in which a reaction occurs, the dilution being calculated without the inclusion of the volume of the corpuscular suspension in the total volume.
In the case of anti-A, anti-B and other reagents intended for use on slides, avidity is expressed by means of the time required for agglutination on a slide.
3. International Standards and International Units
International Standards have been established by the World Health Organization for anti-A and anti-B and incomplete anti-D blood-grouping reagents and are in process of being established for blood-grouping reagents of other specificities. An International Standard Preparation contains, by definition, a certain number of International Units per mg or ml and this definition is independent of the titres observed against particular red corpuscle preparations (2). (1)At the time of approving the present version of the Protocol and its Annexes, it was understood by the representatives of the Contracting Parties that when in the English text of the Agreement the expression "blood incompatibilities" was mentioned, "blood grouping incompatibilities" was implied.
(2)The potency of blood-grouping reagents of most specificities is expressed as the agglutination titre observed in a dilution series, against a suspension of red cells. The titre indicates the dilution of reagent in the last mixture of the series which shows agglutination microscopically visible.
The potency of blood-grouping reagents for which International Standard Preparations exist (at present anti-A and anti-B and incomplete anti-D) can be expressed in International Units (see Bull, Wld. Hlth. Org. 1954, 10, 937, 941-1950, 3, 301) on the basis of the titration of the unknown reagent in comparison with the International Standard, or a national sub-standard.
The International Standard Preparations of blood-grouping sera are dispensed in ampoules containing dried human serum. When reconstituted to the volume of 1 ml, the anti-A and anti-B sera contain by definition 256 International Units per ml. They can be obtained free of charge, from the International Laboratory for Biological Standards of WHO, Statens Seruminstitut, Copenhagen.
The following table shows an example of a comparative titration of the International Standard anti-A Serum (S) and an "unknown" anti-A reagent (U) against A1 red corpuscles and A2B red corpuscles. PIC FILE= "T0045086"
4. Stability and expiry date
Each reagent, when kept under the conditions of storage recommended by the manufacturer, should retain the requisite properties for at least one year.
The expiry date of a reagent in the liquid form as given on the label shall be not more than one year from the date of the last satisfactory potency test. The expiry date can be extended for further periods of one year by repetition of potency tests.
The expiry date of reagents in the dried form as given on the label shall be in accordance with evidence obtained from experiments on stability and shall be approved by the national control authorities.
Blood-grouping reagents may be preserved in the liquid or dried state. Dried reagents shall be kept in an atmosphere of an inert gas or in vacuo, in the glass container in which they were dried and which shall be closed so as to exclude moisture. A dried reagent must not lose more than 0,5 % of its weight when tested by further drying over phosphorus pentoxide at a pressure not exceeding 0,02 mm of mercury for 24 hours.
Reagents shall be prepared with aseptic precautions and shall be free from bacterial contamination. In order to prevent bacterial growth the competent national authority may decide that an antiseptic and/or antibiotic shall be added to the reagent (or to any solvent issued with dried reagents), provided that, in the presence of the added substance, the reagent still fulfils the requirements for specificity and potency.
Blood-grouping sera of human origin must contain at least 2,5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of liquid or reconstituted serum.
Reagents whether in the liquid state or after reconstitution should be transparent and should not contain any sediment, gel or visible particles.
Blood-grouping reagents for international exchanges should preferably not be artificially coloured at least until an international agreement is reached on a uniform system. Any added colouring matter must not interfere with the specific reaction.
Blood-grouping reagents shall be dispensed in such a way and in such volumes that the reagent in one container is sufficient for the performance of tests with positive and negative control corpuscles in addition to the performance of tests with the unknown corpuscles. The volume in one container shall be such that the contents can if necessary be used for the performance of the appropriate tests for potency described in this Protocol.
Written records shall be kept by the producing laboratory of all steps in the production and control of blood-grouping reagents. Adequate samples of all reagents issued shall be retained by the laboratory until it can be reasonably assumed that the batch is no longer in use.
Reagents used for blood-grouping may contain substances of human, animal, vegetable (or mineral) origin, of which some constitute the active principle and others are adjuvants for enhancing the activity or maintaining the stability of the reagent.
For technical reasons these reagents have been divided into three categories according to the origin of their active principle. This does not mean that reagents of human origin contain exclusively substances of human origin or that animal or vegetable reagents cannot contain substances of human origin.
10. Labels, leaflets and certificates
A label printed in English and French, in black on white paper, shall be affixed to each final container and shall contain the following information: 1. Name and address of producer;
2. Name of the reagent as it appears in the heading of the relevant specification;
3. Name and amount of antiseptic and/or antibiotic, if present, or indication of absence;
4. The volume or, where the reagent is dried, the volume and composition of the fluid needed for reconstitution;
Moreover, this label or the label of the carton enclosing several final containers, or the leaflet accompanying the containers, shall contain the following information: 1. Full name and address of producer;
2. Name of the reagent as it appears in the heading of the relevant specification ;
3. The volume, or, where the reagent is dried, the volume and composition of the fluid needed for reconstitution;
4. Date of last potency test;
5. Expiry date (if any);
7. Adequate description of the method of use recommended by the producer;
8. Conditions of storage of unopened ampoules and precautions to be taken after opening;
9. Exact composition, including antiseptic and/or antibiotic if any;
10. Statement whether the product contains or does not contain material of human origin.
Each consignment shall be accompanied by a certificate as provided in Article 4 of the Agreement and the Annex to the present Protocol. Examples of labels and leaflets are attached to the present Protocol.
A. BLOOD-GROUPING SERA OF HUMAN ORIGIN
(a) SERA OF HUMAN ORIGIN FOR AB0 GROUPING (i) Anti-A blood-grouping serum (human)
Anti-A serum is derived from the blood of selected group B persons, who may or may not have been immunized by group A red corpuscles or group A specific substance. Anti-A serum agglutinates human red corpuscles containing A antigen, i.e. those of blood groups A and AB, including sub-groups A1, A2, A1B and A2B, and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain A antigen, i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B.
An anti-A serum shall be titrated separately against suspensions of A1, A2, and A2B corpuscles, in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or an equivalent reference preparation. The potency of the serum shall in each case be not less than 64 International Units per ml.
When anti-A serum is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of A1, A2 and A2B cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1, agglutination of each suspension should first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same test is performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or with a reference standard of equivalent avidity.
(ii) Anti-B blood-grouping serum (human)
Anti-B serum is derived from the blood of selected group A persons, who may or may not have been immunized by group B red corpuscles or group B specific substance. Anti-B serum agglutinates human red corpuscles containing B antigen, i.e. those of blood groups B and AB, and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain B antigen, i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A.
An anti-B serum shall be titrated against a suspension of group B corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or an equivalent reference preparation. The potency of the serum shall be not less than 64 International Units per ml.
When anti-B serum is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of B cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1, agglutination should first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same test is performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or with reference standard of equivalent avidity.
(iii) Anti-A + Anti-B (group 0) blood-grouping serum (human)
Anti-A + anti-B (group 0) serum is derived from the blood of selected group 0 persons who may or may not have been immunized by group A and group B red corpuscles or group A and group B specific substances. Anti-A + anti-B (group 0) serum agglutinates human red corpuscles containing A or B agglutinogens or both, i.e. those of group A including subgroups A1 and A2, group B and group AB including subgroups A1B and A2B, and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain A or B agglutinogens, i.e. those of group 0. It agglutinates human red corpuscles containing the Ax (Ay or Ao) antigen (which are not, in general, agglutinated by anti-A serum derived from group B donors).
An anti-A + anti-B (group 0) serum shall be titrated separately against suspensions of A1, and A2 corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or an equivalent standard preparation. It shall also be titrated against a suspension of group B corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood grouping serum or an equivalent standard preparation.
The potency of the serum shall in every case be not less than 64 International Units per ml.
Anti-A + anti-B (group 0) blood-grouping serum used undiluted shall also give readily detectable agglutination of group Ax (Ay or Ao) corpuscles.
(b) SERA OF HUMAN ORIGIN FOR Rh GROUPING
Anti-Rh blood-grouping sera, whatever their specificity, may be of either of two varieties differing in the conditions under which agglutination of homologous corpuscles is obtained. Certain sera commonly known as "complete" agglutinate corpuscles suspended in saline. With others, commonly known as "incomplete", agglutination can only be obtained in the presence of certain colloids such as bovine albumin or by means of other special techniques. The sera should be used under the conditions specified by the laboratory preparing them.
Some "incomplete" sera will also agglutinate homologous red corpuscles suspended in their own serum or plasma on slides.
The following requirements of potency for Rh grouping sera may need to be revised when International Standard Preparations become available. (i) Anti-D (anti-Rho) blood-grouping serum (human)
Anti-D serum is derived from the blood of one or more persons immunized by the D antigen of the Rh system. It reacts with human red corpuscles containing the D antigen, but not with human red corpuscles which do not contain the D antigen.
"Complete" anti-D sera shall have a titre of not less than 32 against CcDee cells in a solution containing 9 grams sodium chloride per litre.
An "incomplete" anti-D serum shall be titrated against CcDee corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of Incomplete Anti-D (anti-Rho) or an equivalent reference preparation. It shall have a potency of not less than 32 International Units. Besides reacting with all red corpuscles containing the D antigen, the serum should, as far as possible, react with corpuscles containing the Du antigen.
Anti-D sera intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson should, when mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a 40 to 50 % suspension of CcDee corpuscles at approximately 40 °C, show visible agglutination within 30 seconds, and agglutination should be complete within 120 seconds.
(ii) Anti-C (anti Rh') blood-grouping serum (human)
Anti-C serum is derived from the blood of one or more persons immunized by the C agglutinogen of the Rh system. It agglutinates suspensions of human red corpuscles containing the C antigen, but not with human red corpuscles which do not contain the C antigen. In this connection the C antigen is regarded as including the Cw antigen.
Most diagnostic anti-C sera contain "complete" anti-C together with "incomplete" anti-D. These sera are therefore specific for the C antigen only when the cells under test are suspended in a solution containing 9 grams sodium chloride per litre.
Anti-C sera ("complete" or "incomplete") should have a titre of not less than 8 against Ccddee corpuscles.
Anti-C sera intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson (and which must not contain any form of anti-D) should, when mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of Ccddee cells with a volume fraction of 0,4 to 0,5, at approximately 40 °C, show visible agglutination within 30 seconds, and agglutination should be complete within 120 seconds.
(iii) Anti-E (anti-rh") blood-grouping serum (human)
Anti-E serum is derived from the blood of one or more persons immunized by the E antigen of the Rh system. It reacts with human red corpuscles containing the E antigen.
Anti-E sera ("complete" or "incomplete") should have a titre of not less than 8 against ccddEe corpuscles.
Anti-E sera intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson (and which must contain any form of anti-D) should, when mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of ccddEe cells with a volume fraction of 0,4 to 0,5, at approximately 40 °C, show visible agglutination within 30 seconds, and agglutination should be complete within 120 seconds.
(iv) Anti-D + C (anti-Rhorh') blood-grouping serum (human)
Anti-D + E (anti-Rhorh") blood-grouping serum (human)
B. REAGENTS OF NON-HUMAN ORIGIN
(a) SERA OF ANIMAL ORIGIN (i) Anti-A blood-grouping serum (animal)
Anti-A serum is derived from the blood of animals which may or may not have been immunized by group A red corpuscles or group A specific substances. Anti-A serum agglutinates human red corpuscles containing A antigen, i.e. those of blood groups A and AB, including sub-groups A1, A2, A1B and A2B, and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain A antigen, i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B.
An anti-A serum shall be titrated separately against suspensions of A1, A2, and A2B red corpuscles, in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or an equivalent reference preparation (1). The potency of the serum shall in each case be not less than 64 International Units per ml.
When anti-A serum is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of A1, A2 and A2B cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1, agglutination of each suspension shall in each case first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same test is performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or with a reference standard of equivalent avidity.
(ii) Anti-B blood-grouping serum (animal)
Anti-B serum is derived from the blood of animals which may or may not have been immunized by group B red corpuscles or group B specific substances. Anti-B serum agglutinates human red corpuscles containing B antigen, i.e. those of blood groups B and AB, and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain B antigen, i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A.
An anti-B serum shall be titrated against a suspension of group B corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or an equivalent reference preparation (1). The potency of the serum shall be not less than 64 International Units per ml.
When anti-B serum is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of B cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1, agglutination shall first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same test is performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or with a reference standard of equivalent avidity.
(iii) Anti-human-globulin serum (animal) (2)
Anti-human globulin serum for use in blood group serology must contain agglutinating antibodies against IgG globulin and agglutinating antibodies against complement factors. It is derived from the blood of animals immunized by the injection of human serum protein. It must agglutinate all human red corpuscles coated with human IgG and/or complement factors. Under the conditions specified by the manufacturers it does not agglutinate uncoated human red corpuscles, to whatever group they may belong.
An anti-human globulin serum, as supplied, or at the dilution recommended on the label, shall strongly agglutinate human red corpuscles coated with a human incomplete anti-D serum, having a titre of 4 (or less) against D-positive corpuscles, when the titration is performed by the albumin replacement method. At the same dilution it shall agglutinate K-positive human red corpuscles sensitized with selected weak anti-K antibodies and Fya positive red corpuscles sensitized with selected weak anti-Fya antibodies.
It shall also, at the same or a different dilution, as specified on the label, agglutinate human red corpuscles sensitized with weak complement-binding incomplete anti-Lea antibodies in the presence of fresh serum.
For clinical use it is desirable that the coating of all the types of incomplete antibodies above shall be detectable with a single dilution of the anti-human globulin serum.
(b) BLOOD-GROUPING REAGENTS OF VEGETABLE ORIGIN (i) Anti-A blood-grouping reagent (vegetable)
Anti-A reagent is prepared by extraction from the seeds or other parts of a suitable plant, followed, if necessary, by purification. Anti-A reagent agglutinates human red corpuscles containing A antigens, i.e. those of blood groups A and AB, including sub-groups A1, A2, A1B and A2B, and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain A antigens, i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B.
An anti-A reagent shall be titrated separately against suspensions of A1, A2 and A2B corpuscles, in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or an equivalent reference preparation (1).
The potency of the reagent shall in each case be not less than 64 International Units per ml.
When anti-A reagent is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of A1, A2 and A2B cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1, agglutination of each suspension shall first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same test is performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or with a reference standard of equivalent avidity.
(ii) Anti-B blood-grouping reagent (vegetable)
Anti-B reagent is prepared by extraction from the appropriate part of a suitable plant, followed, if necessary, by purification. Anti-B reagent agglutinates human red corpuscles containing B antigen, i.e. those of blood groups B and AB, and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain B antigen, i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A.
An anti-B reagent shall be titrated against a suspension of group B corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or an equivalent reference preparation (1). The potency of the reagent shall not be less than 64 International Units per ml.
When anti-B reagent is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of B cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1, agglutination shall first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same test is performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or with a reference standard of equivalent avidity.
(1) The International Standard Preparation is of human origin ; an equivalent reference preparation, if used, may be of human or non-human origin.

CONVENTION on the simplification of formalities in trade in goods
AND THE REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA, THE REPUBLIC OF FINLAND, THE REPUBLIC OF ICELAND, THE KINGDOM OF NORWAY, THE KINGDOM OF SWEDEN AND THE SWISS CONFEDERATION
(hereinafter called the EFTA countries)
CONSIDERING the Free Trade Agreements between the Community and each of the EFTA countries;
CONSIDERING the Joint Declaration calling for the creation of a European economic space, adopted by Ministers of the EFTA countries and the Member States of the Community and the Commission of the European Communities in Luxembourg on 9 April 1984, especially with regard to simplification of border formalities and rules of origin;
CONSIDERING that, in the framework of action to strengthen the internal market, the Community has decided to introduce a single administrative document for use in such trade from 1 January 1988;
CONSIDERING it appropriate to simplify also formalities in trade in goods between the Community and the EFTA countries as well as between the EFTA countries themselves, in particular by introducing a single administrative document;
CONSIDERING that no provision of this Convention may be interpreted as exempting the Contracting Parties from their obligations under other international agreements,
HAVE DECIDED TO CONCLUDE THE FOLLOWING CONVENTION:
This Convention lays down measures to simplify formalities in trade in goods between the Community and the EFTA countries, as well as between the EFTA countries themselves, in particular by introducing a single administrative document (hereinafter referred to as the single document) to be used for any procedure at export and import and for a common transit procedure applicable to trade between the Contracting Parties (hereinafter referred to as transit), regardless of the kind and origin of the goods.
Where goods are the subject of trade between the Contracting Parties, the formalities connected with such trade shall be completed using a single document based on a declaration form, the specimens of which are to be found in Annex I to this Convention. The single document shall, depending on the circumstances, serve as a declaration or document of export, transit or import.
Administrative documents may be required by a Contracting Party in addition to the single document only where:
- expressly required for the implementation of a legislation in force in a Contracting Party for which the use of the single document would not suffice;
- required under the terms of international agreements to which it is a party;
1. Nothing in this Convention shall preclude the Contracting Parties from applying simplified procedures, whether or not based on the use of computers, with a view to greater simplification for operators.
2. Simplified procedures may, in particular, consist in allowing operators not to have to present to a customs office either the goods in question or the declaration relating to them, or in allowing them to draw up an incomplete declaration. In such cases, a declaration, which, if the competent authorities agree, may be a general periodic declaration, must be submitted subsequently within the time-limits laid down by those authorities.
In the cases referred to in paragraph 1, operators may be authorized to use commercial documents in the place of the single document.
Where the single document is used, the persons concerned may, on authorization by the competent authorities, attach to it commercial schedules describing the goods in lieu of continuation sheets of the single document for the purpose of completing formalities for any procedure at export and import.
3. Nothing in this Convention shall preclude the Contracting Parties from:
- dispensing with the single document with regard to postal traffic (by letter or parcel post);
- dispensing with the requirement of written declarations;
- concluding between themselves agreements or arrangements with a view to greater simplification of formalities in all or part of the trade between them;
- allowing the use of loading lists for the completion of transit formalities in the case of consignments composed of several kinds of goods, in lieu of continuation sheets of the single document;
- allowing declarations to be made, where appropriate on plain paper, by means of public or private computers on conditions fixed by the competent authorities;
- enabling the competent authorities to require that data necessary for completing the formalities in question be entered in their computerized declaration-processing systems without, where appropriate, requiring a written declaration;
- enabling the competent authorities, should a computerized declaration-processing system be used, to provide that the export, transit or import declaration be constituted either by the single document produced by that system or by entry of the data in the computer if such a document is not produced;
- applying any facility adopted by way of a decision of the Joint Committee, as referred to in Article 11 (3).
1. Provisions on the completion, by means of the single document, of the formalities needed for the export, transit and import of the goods are laid down in Annex II to this Convention.
2. The common codes to be used in the forms laid down in Annex I are to be found in Annex III to this Convention.
1. The declaration must be completed in one of the official languages of the Contracting Parties which is acceptable to the competent authorities of the country in which the export or transit formalities are completed. Where necessary, the customs authority of the country of destination or of transit may require from the declarant or his representative in that country a translation of the said declaration into the official language or one of the official languages of that country.
2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the declaration shall be completed in one of the official languages of the country of import in all cases where the declaration in that country is made on copies of the declaration from other than those presented to the customs authorities of the country of export or departure.
1. The declarant or his representative may, for each stage of an operation involving trade in goods between Contracting Parties, use the copies of the declaration necessary for completion of the formalities relating to that stage alone, to which may be attached, where appropriate, the copies necessary for completion of the formalities relating to one or other of the subsequent stages of that operation.
2. The benefit of the provisions of paragraph 1 shall not be subject to compliance with any special condition imposed by the competent authorities.
However, without prejudice to specific provisions concerning groupage traffic, the competent authorities may lay down that formalities relating to export and transit operations should be completed on the same form by means of copies corresponding to these formalities.
In the cases referred to in Article 7, the competent authorities shall, to the extent possible, satisfy themselves that the particulars given in the copies of the declaration drawn up in the course of the various stages of the operation in question all agree.
2. Assistance may be withheld or denied, totally or partly, when the requested country considers that the assistance would be prejudicial to its security, public policy (ordre public) or other essential interests, or would violate an industrial, commercial or professional secret.
3. If assistance is withheld or denied, the decision and the reasons therefor must be notified to the requesting country without delay.
4. If the customs authority of a country requests assistance which it would not be able to give if requested, it shall draw attention to that fact in the request. Compliance with such a request shall be at the discretion of the customs authority to whom the request is made.
5. Information obtained in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be used solely for the purposes of this Convention and shall be accorded the same protection by a receiving country as is afforded to information of like nature under the national law of that country. Such information may be used for other purposes only with the written consent of the customs authority which furnished them and subject to any restrictions laid down by that authority.
1. A Joint Committee is hereby established in which each Contracting Party to this Convention shall be represented.
2. The Joint Committee shall act by mutual agreement.
3. The Joint Committee shall meet whenever necessary but at least once a year. Any Contracting Party may request that a meeting be held.
4. The Joint Committee shall adopt its own rules of procedure which shall contain, inter alia, provisions for convening meetings and for the designation of the Chairman and his term of office.
5. The Joint Committee may decide to set up any Sub-Committee or Working Party that can assist it in carrying out its duties.
1. It shall be the responsibility of the Joint Committee to administer this Convention and ensure its proper implementation. For this purpose, the said Committee shall be kept regularly informed, by the Contracting Parties, of the experiences gained from application of the Convention, shall make recommendations, and, in the cases provided for in paragraph 3, shall take decisions.
2. In particular, the Joint Committee shall recommend:
(a) amendments to this Convention;
(b) any other measure required for its application.
3. The Joint Committee shall adopt, by decision, amendments to the Annexes to this Convention and facilities referred to in the last indent of Article 4 (3). Such decisions shall put into effect by the Contracting Parties in accordance with their own legislation.
4. If a Contracting Party's representative in the Joint Committee has accepted a decision subject to the fulfilment of constitutional requirements, the decision shall enter into force, if no date is contained therein, on the first day of the second month following notification that the reservation has been lifted.
Each Contracting Party shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the provisions of this Convention are effectively and harmoniously applied taking into account the need to reduce as far as possible the formalities imposed on trade and the need to achieve mutually satisfactory solutions of any difficulties arising out of the operation of those provisions.
The Contracting Parties shall keep each other informed of the provisions which they adopt for the implementation of this Convention.
The Annexes to this Convention shall form an integral part thereof.
1. This Convention shall apply, on the one hand, to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and under the conditions laid down in that Treaty and, on the other hand, to the territories of the EFTA countries.
2. This Convention shall also apply to the Principality of Lichtenstein for as long as that Principality remains bound to the Swiss Confederation by a customs union treaty.
Any Contracting Party may withdraw from this Convention provided it gives twelve months' notice in writing to the depositary referred to in Article 17 which shall notify all other Contracting Parties.
1. This Convention shall enter into force on 1 January 1988, provided that, before 1 November 1987, the Contracting Parties have deposited their instruments of acceptance with the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities, which shall act as depositary.
2. If this Convention does not enter into force on
1 January 1988, it shall do so on the first day of the second month following the deposit of the last instrument of acceptance.
This Convention, drawn up in a single original of the Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Icelandic, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish languages, all texts being equally authentic, shall be deposited in the archives of the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities, which shall transmit a certified copy thereof to each Contracting Party.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT ON OLIVE OIL AND TABLE OLIVES, 1986
THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT,
BEARING IN MIND that the olive tree:
- is not only a plant indispensable for the maintenance and conservation of soils, but one which makes it possible to develop land that will not bear other crops and which, even under non-intensive farming conditions, which account for the bulk of present production, responds favourably to any improvement in cultivation,
- is a perennial fruit tree that, with appropriate techniques, permits a return on what is invested in its cultivation,
EMPHASIZING that its cultivation governs the existence and standard of living of millions of families which are wholly dependent on the measures taken to maintain and expand the consumption of its products, both in the producing countries themselves and in non-producing consumer countries,
MINDFUL that olive oil and table olives are essential basic commodities in the regions where olive-growing is established,
BEARING IN MIND that the essential feature of olive production lies in irregular harvests and in the irregularity with which supplies reach the market, and that this results in fluctuations in the value of production, instability of prices and export earnings, and considerable differences in producers incomes,
BEARING IN MIND that these circumstances give rise to special difficulties which may seriously harm the interests of producers and consumers and jeopardize general policies of economic expansion in countries in the regiones where olive-growing is established,
EMPHASIZING in this connection the major importance of olive production to the economies of many countries, particularly developing olive-growing countries,
MINDFUL that the measures to be taken in the light of the very particular characteristics of olive-growing and of the market for its products transcend the national sphere, and that international action is essential,
CONSIDERING the International Olive Oil Agreement, 1956, as amended by the Protocol of 3 April 1958, as well as the International Olive Oil Agreement, 1963, as extended and amended on several occasions, and the International Olive Oil Agreement, 1979,
CONSIDERING that the 1979 Agreement will expire on 31 December 1986,
BEING OF THE VIEW that it is essential to continue and develop the work undertaken within the framework of the said Agreements and that it is desirable to conclude a new Agreement,
The objectives of the International Agreement on Olive Oil and Table Olives, 1986 (Hereinafter termed 'this

(iii) reduce the cost of production of the products obtained, particularly that of olive oil, with a view to improving the position of that oil in the overall market for fluid edible vegetable oils;
(iv) improve the situation of the olive-products industry as regards the environment, in accordance with the recommendations of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, to abate any harmful effects;
(b) To encourage the transfer of technology and training in the olive sector.
3. With respect to the expansion of international trade in olive products:
(a) To facilitate the study and application of measures designed to expand international trade in olive products in order to increase the resources that producer countries, and especially developing producer countries, derive from their exports and to enable their economic growth and social development to be hastened, while taking consumer interests into account;
(b) To adopt whatever measures are appropriate to develop the consumption of olive oil and table olives;
(c) To forestall and, where appropriate, combat any practices of unfair competition in international trade in olive oil, olive-pomace oils and table olives
and to ensure the delivery of merchandise that complies fully with the international regulations and standards adopted in this field;
(d) To improve market access and reliability of supply, as well as market structures and marketing, distribution and transport systems;
(e) To undertake any activities and measures that could highlight the biological value of olive oil and table olives.
4. With respect to the standardization of international trade in olive products:
(a) To facilitate the study and application of measures for balancing production and consumption;
(b) To facilitate the study and application of measures for harmonizing national laws relating, in particular, to the marketing of olive oil and table olives;
(c) To lessen the drawbacks associated with fluctuations in the availability of supplies on the market, in order in particular:
I(i) to prevent excessive fluctuations in prices, which must be at levels that are remunerative and just to producers and equitable to consumers;
(ii) to create conditions that will enable production, consumption and international trade to expand harmoniously, having regard to the ways in which they are interrelated;
(d) To improve procedures for information and consultation in order, inter alia, to enhance the transparency of the market for olive oil, olive-pomace oils and table olives.

1. This Convention lays down measures for the carriage of goods in transit between the Community and the EFTA countries as well as between the EFTA countries themselves, including, where applicable, goods transhipped, reconsigned or warehoused, by introducing a common transit procedure regardless of the kind and origin of the goods.
2. Without prejudice to the provisions of this Convention and in particular those concerning guarantees, goods circulating within the Community are deemed to be placed under the Community transit procedure.
3. Subject to the provisions of Articles 7 to 12 below, the rules governing the common transit procedure are set out in Appendices I and II to this Convention.
4. Transit declarations and transit documents for the purposes of the common transit procedure shall conform to and be made out in accordance with Appendix III.
1. The common transit procedure shall hereinafter be described as the T 1 procedure or the T 2 procedure, as the case may be.
2. The T 1 procedure may be applied to any goods carried in accordance with Article 1, paragraph 1.
3. The T 2 procedure shall apply to goods carried in accordance with Article 1, paragraph 1:
(a) in the Community, only when the goods satisfy the conditions laid down in Articles 9 and 10 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community and have not been subject to customs export formalities for the grant of refunds for export to countries, not Member States of the Community, pursuant to the common agricultural policy or when the goods come under the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community and are, under the terms of that Treaty, in free circulation within the Community (Community goods);
(b) in an EFTA country, only when the goods have arrived in that EFTA country under the T 2 procedure and are reconsigned under the special conditions laid down in Article 9 below.
4. The special conditions laid down in this Convention in respect of placing goods under the T 2 procedure shall apply also to the issue of T 2 L documents certifying the Community status of goods and goods covered by a T 2 L document shall be treated in the same way as goods carried under the T 2 procedure, except that the T 2 L document need not accompany the goods.
1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term:
(a) 'transit' shall mean a customs procedure under which goods are carried, under customs control, from a customs office in one country to a customs office in the same or another country over at least one frontier;
(b) 'country', shall mean any EFTA country and any Member State of the Community;
(c) 'third country' shall mean any State which is neither an EFTA country nor a Member State of the Community.
2. In the application of the rules laid down in this Convention for the T 1 or T 2 procedure, the EFTA countries, and the Community and its Member States, shall have the same rights and obligations.
1. This Convention shall be without prejudice to the application of any other international agreement concerning a transit procedure, in particular the TIR procedure or the Rhine manifest, subject to any limitations to such application in respect of the carriage of goods from one point in the Community to another point in the Community and to any limitations to the issue of T 2 L documents certifying the Community status of goods.
2. This Convention shall be without prejudice also to:
Provided that the implementation of any measures applicable to the goods is ensured, countries may, within the T 1 or T 2 procedure, introduce simplified procedures for certain types of traffic by means of bilateral or multilateral agreements. Such agreements shall be notified to the Commission of the European Communities which shall inform the other countries.
Implementation of the transit procedure
1. Subject to any special provisions of this Convention, the competent customs offices of the EFTA countries are empowered to assume the functions of offices of departure, offices of transit, offices of destination and offices of guarantee.
2. The competent customs offices of the Member States of the Community shall be empowered to issue T 1 or T 2 documents for transit to an office of destination situated in an EFTA country. Subject to any special provisions of this Convention, they shall also be empowered to issue T 2 L documents for goods consigned to an EFTA country.
3. Where several consignments of goods are grouped together and loaded on a single means of transport, within the meaning of Article 16, paragraph 2, of Appendix I, and are dispatched as a groupage load by one principal in a single T 1 or T 2 operation, from one office of departure to one office of destination for delivery to one consignee, a Contracting Party may require that those consignments shall, save in exceptional, duly justified cases, be included in one single T 1 or T 2 declaration with the corresponding loading lists.
N° addition, removal or substitution may be made in the case of goods forwarded under cover of a T 1 or T 2 document, in particular when consignments are split up, transhipped or bulked.
1. Goods which are brought into an EFTA country under the T 2 procedure and may be reconsigned under that procedure shall remain at all times under the control of the customs authorities of that country to ensure that there is no change in their identity or state.
2. Where such goods are reconsigned from an EFTA country after having been placed, in that EFTA country, under a customs procedure other than a transit or a warehousing procedure, no T 2 procedure may be applied.
This provision shall, however, not apply to goods which are admitted temporarily to be shown at an exhibition, fair or similar public display and which have received no treatment other than that needed for their preservation in their original state or for splitting up consignments.
3. Where goods are reconsigned from an EFTA country after storage under a warehousing procedure, the T 2 procedure may be applied only on the following conditions:
- that the goods have not been warehoused over a period exceeding five years; however, as regards goods falling within Chapters 1 to 24 of the Nomenclature for the Classification of Goods in Customs Tariffs (International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System of 14 June 1983), that period shall be limited to six months,
- that the goods have been stored in special spaces and have received no treatment other than that needed for their preservation in their original state, or for splitting up consignments without replacing the packaging.
- that any treatment has taken place under customs supervision.
4. Any T 2 ot T 2 L document issued by a customs office of an EFTA country shall bear a reference to the corresponding T 2 or T 2 L document under which the goods arrived in that EFTA country and shall include all special endorsements appearing thereon.
1. Except where otherwise provided for in paragraph 2 below or in the Appendices, any T 1 or T 2 operation shall be covered by a guarantee valid for all countries involved in that operation.
2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not prejudice the right:
(a) of Contracting Parties to agree among themselves that the guarantee shall be waived for T 1 or T 2 operations involving only their territories;
(b) of a Contracting Party not to require a guarantee for the part of a T 1 or T 2 operation between the office of departure and the first office of transit.
3. For the purposes of the flat-rate guarantee as provided for in Appendices I and II to this Convention, the ECU means the total of the following amounts:
The value of the ECU in a given currency shall be equal to the sum of the exchange values in that currency of the amounts set out above.
1. As a general rule, identification of the goods shall be ensured by sealing.
(a) the space containing the goods, when the means of transport has already been approved under other customs regulations or recognized by the office of departure as suitable for sealing;
(b) each individual package in other cases.
3. Means of transport may be recognized as suitable for sealing on condition that:
(a) seals can be simply and effectively affixed to them;
(b) they are so constructed that no goods can be removed or introduced without leaving visible traces of tampering or without breaking the seals;
(c) they contain no concealed spaces where goods may be hidden;
(d) the spaces reserved for the load are readily accessible for customs inspection.
4. The office of departure may dispense with sealing if, having regard to other possible measures for identification, the description of the goods in the T 1 or T 2 declaration or in the supplementary documents makes them readily identifiable.
1. Until a procedure has been agreed for the exchange of statistical information to ensure that the EFTA countries and the Member States of the Community have the data necessary for the preparation of their transit statistics, an additional copy of the copy N° 4 of the T 1 and T 2 documents shall be supplied for statistical purposes unless not required by a Contracting Party:
(a) to the first office of transit in each EFTA country;
(b) to the first office of transit in the Community in the case of goods which are the subject of a T 1 or T 2 operation commencing in an EFTA country.
2. However, the additional copy referred to above shall not be required when the goods are carried under the conditions laid down in Chapter I of Title IV of Appendix II.
3. The principal or his authorized representative shall, at the request of the national departments responsible for transit statistics, provide any information relating to T 1 or T 2 documents necessary for the compilation of statistics.
1. The customs authorities of the countries concerned shall furnish each other with any information at their disposal which is of importance in order to verify the proper application of this Convention.
2. Where necessary, the customs authorities of the countries concerned shall communicate to one another all findings, documents, reports, records of proceedings and information relating to transport operations carried out under the T 1 or T 2 procedure as well as to irregularities or infringements in connection with such operations.
Furthermore, where necessary, they shall communicate to one another all findings relating to goods in respect of which mutual assistance is provided for and which have been subject to a customs warehousing procedure.
3. Where irregularities or infringements are suspected in connection with goods which have been brought into one country from another country or have passed through a country or have been stored under a warehousing procedure, the customs authorities of the countries concerned shall on request communicate to one another all information concerning:
a) the conditions under which those goods were carried:
- whatever the way in which they were reconsigned, where they arrived under cover of a T 1, T 2 or T 2 L document in the country to which the request is addressed, or
- whatever the way in which they arrived, where they were reconsigned under cover of a T 1, T 2 or T 2 L document from the country to which the request is addressed:
b) the conditions of any warehousing of those goods where they arrived in the country to which the request is addressed under cover of a T 2 or T 2 L document or where they were reconsigned from that country under cover of a T 2 or T 2 L document.
4. Any request made under paragraphs 1 to 3 shall specify the case or cases to which it refers.
5. If the customs authority of a country requests assistance which it would not be able to give if requested, it will draw attention to that fact in the request. Compliance with such a request will be within the discretion of the customs authority to whom the request is made.
6. Information obtained in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 3 shall be used solely for the purposes of this Convention and shall be accorded the same protection by a receiving country as is afforded to information of like nature under the national law of that country.

2. 'Parties' means, unless the text indicates, Parties to this Protocol.
3. 'Secretariat' means the secretariat of the Convention.
4. 'Controlled substance' means a substance listed in Annex A to this Protocol, whether existing alone or in a mixture. It excludes, however, any such substance or mixture which is in a manufactured product other than a container used for the transportation or storage of the substance listed.
5. 'Production' means the amount of controlled substances produced minus the amount destroyed by technologies to be approved by the Parties.
6. 'Consumption' means production plus imports minus exports of controlled substances.
7. 'Calculated levels' of production, imports, exports and consumption means levels determined in accordance with Article 3.
8. 'Industrial rationalization' means the transfer of all or a portion of the calculated level of production of one Party to another, for the purpose of achieving economic efficiencies or responding to anticipated shortfalls in supply as a result of plant closures.
the date of the entry into force of this Protocol, and in each 12-month period thereafter, its calculated level of consumption of the controlled substances in Group I of Annex A does not exceed its calculated level of consumption in 1986. By the end of the same period, each Party producing one or more of these substances shall ensure that its calculated level of production of the substances does not exceed its calculated level of production in 1986, except that such level may have increased by no more than 10 % based on the 1986 level. Such increase shall be permitted only so as to satisfy the basic domestic needs of the Parties operating under Article 5 and for the purposes of industrial rationalization between Parties.
2. Each Party shall ensure that for the 12-month period commencing on the first day of the 37th month following the date of the entry into force of this Protocol, and in each 12-month period thereafter, its calculated level of consumption of the controlled substances listed in Group II of Annex A does not exceed its calculated level of consumption in 1986. Each Party producing one or more of these substances shall ensure that its calculated level of production of the substances does not exceed its calculated level of production in 1986, except that such level may have increased by no more than 10 % based on the 1986 level.

3. Each Party shall ensure that for the period 1 July 1993 to 30 June 1994 and in each 12-month period thereafter, its calculated level of consumption of the controlled substances in Group I of Annex A does not exceed, annually, 80 % of its calculated level of consumption in 1986. Each Party producing one or more of these substances shall, for the same periods, ensure that its calculated level of production of the substances does not exceed, annually, 80 % of its calculated level of production in 1986. However, in order to satisfy the basic domestic needs of the Parties operating under Article 5 and for the purposes of industrial rationalization between Parties, its calculated level of production may exceed that limit by up to 10 % of its calculated level of production in 1986.
5. Any Party whose calculated level of production in 1986 of the controlled substances in Group I of Annex A was less than 25 kilotonnes may, for the purposes of industrial rationalization, transfer to or receive from any other Party, production in excess of the limits set out in paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 provided that the total combined calculated levels of production of the Parties concerned does not exceed the production limits set out in this Article. Any transfer of such production shall be notified to the secretariat, no later than the time of the transfer.
6. Any Party not operating under Article 5, that has facilities for the production of controlled substances under construction, or contracted for, prior to 16 September 1987, and provided for in national legislation prior to 1 January 1987, may add the production from such facilities to its 1986 production of such substances for the purposes of determining its calculated level of production for 1986, provided that such facilities are completed by 31 December 1990 and that such production does not raise that Party's annual calculated level of consumption of the controlled substances above 0,5 kilograms per capita.
7. Any transfer of production pursuant to paragraph 5 or any addition of production pursuant to paragraph 6 shall be notified to the secretariat, no later than the time of the transfer or addition.
(b) The Parties to any such agreement shall inform the secretariat of the terms of the agreement before the date of the reduction in consumption with which the agreement is concerned.
(c) Such agreement will become operative only if all Member States of the regional economic integration organization and the organization concerned are Parties to the Protocol and have notified the secretariat of their manner of implementation.
i(i) adjustments to the ozone-depleting potentials specified in Annex A should be made and, if so, what the adjustments should be; and
(ii) further adjustments and reductions of production or consumption of the controlled substances from 1986 levels should be undertaken and, if so, what the scope, amount and timing of any such adjustment and reductions should be.
(b) Proposals for such adjustments shall be communicated to the Parties by the secretariat at least six month before the meeting of the Parties at which they are proposed for adoption.
(c) In taking such decisions, the Parties shall make every effort to reach agreement by consensus. If all efforts at consensus have been exhausted, and no agreement reached, such decisions shall, as a last resort, be adopted by a two-thirds majority vote of the Parties present and voting representing at least 50 % of the total consumption of the controlled substances of the Parties.
(d) The decisions, which shall be binding on all Parties, shall forthwith be communicated to the Parties by the Depositary. Unless otherwise provided in the decisions, they shall enter into force on the expiry of six months from the date of the circulation of the communication by the Depositary.
