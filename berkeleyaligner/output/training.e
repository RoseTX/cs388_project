prohibiting fishing for northern prawns by vessels flying the flag of a member state other than estonia, latvia, lithuania or poland
the commission of the european communities,
having regard to the treaty establishing the european community,
having regard to council regulation (eec) no 2847/93 of 12 october 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy [1], and in particular article 21(3) thereof,
(1) council regulation (ec) no 27/2005 of 22 december 2004 fixing for 2005 the fishing opportunities and associated fishing conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in community waters and, for community vessels, in waters where limitations in catch are required, lays down quotas for northern prawns for 2005 [2].

commission regulation (ec) no 558/2005
amending regulations (eec) no 3846/87 establishing an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds and (ec) no 174/1999 laying down special detailed rules for the application of council regulation (eec) no 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds in the case of milk and milk products
the commission of the european communities,
having regard to the treaty establishing the european community,
having regard to council regulation (ec) no 1255/1999 of 17 may 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in milk and milk products [1], and in particular article 31(14) thereof,
(1) commission regulation (eec) no 3846/87 [2], on the basis of the combined nomenclature, establishes an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds.
(2) the refund nomenclature provides for cheeses to be eligible for an export refund if they meet minimum requirements as regards milk dry matter and milk fat. a type of cheese produced in some new member states may meet those necessary requirements but may not benefit from a refund since it is not covered by the present classification system of the export refund nomenclature. given the importance of that cheese for the dairy industry, trade and milk producers involved, it is appropriate to add a product code under an "other cheeses" position enabling that cheese to be classified under the export refund nomenclature.
(3) the quantities for which export licences are requested in the product category "cheeses" are continually exceeding the profile of the export limits imposed on the community in the framework of the agreement on agriculture following the uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations. the additional export licences which will be applied for under the newly created position will further increase the pressure on the category.
(4) article 3 of commission regulation (ec) no 174/1999 [3] provides that no refund shall be granted on exports of cheese where the free-at-frontier price prior to application of the refund in the member state of export is less than eur 230 per 100 kilograms. cheese falling within code 0406 90 33 9919 of the nomenclature for refunds is exempt from this provision. it is appropriate in these circumstances and given the high level of demand for export licences for cheeses to apply this provision to all cheeses without exception.
(5) footnote 10 of sector 9 of annex i of regulation (eec) no 3846/87, applicable to grated, powdered and processed cheeses, states that added non-lactic matter will not be taken into account for the purpose of calculating the refund. it is appropriate to extend this provision to all cheeses and to better describe the non-lactic matter concerned. it may not be possible for the exporter and even more difficult for the competent authorities to determine the weight of these matters. it is therefore appropriate to reduce the refund by a standard amount.
(6) the refund is granted on the net weight of the cheeses. some confusion may exist in cases where cheeses are contained in an envelope of paraffin, ash or wax or wrapped in a film of plastic. it is appropriate to provide that such packing are not a part of the net weight of the product for the purpose of calculating the refund. it may not be possible for the exporter and for the competent authorities, as regards the plastic film, the paraffin and the ash, to determine the weight of such materials. it is therefore suitable to reduce the refund by a standard amount.
(7) regulations (eec) no 3846/87 and (ec) no 174/1999 should be amended accordingly.
(8) the measures provided for in this regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the management committee for milk and milk products,
annex i to regulation (eec) no 3846/87 is amended in accordance with the annex to this regulation.
in article 3 of regulation (ec) no 174/1999 the fourth paragraph is deleted.
this regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the official journal of the european union.
it shall apply on export licences applied for from 27 may 2005.
this regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all member states.
commission regulation (ec) no 559/2005
on initiating an investigation concerning the possible circumvention of anti-dumping measures imposed by council regulation (ec) no 2074/2004 on imports of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the peopleâ€™s republic of china by imports of certain ring binder mechanisms consigned from lao peopleâ€™s democratic republic, whether declared as originating in lao peopleâ€™s democratic republic or not and making such imports subject to registration
the commission of the european communities,
having regard to the treaty establishing the european community,
having regard to council regulation (ec) no 384/96 of 22 december 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the european community [1] (the basic regulation), and in particular articles 13(3), 14(3) and 14(5) thereof,
after having consulted the advisory committee,
(1) the commission has received a request pursuant to article 13(3) of the basic regulation to investigate the possible circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the peopleâ€™s republic of china.
(2) the request has been lodged on 28 february 2005 by ring alliance ringbuchtechnik gmbh on behalf of producers representing more than 70 % of the community production of certain ring binder mechanisms.
(3) the product concerned by the possible circumvention is certain ring binder mechanisms normally declared under cn code ex83051000 originating in the peopleâ€™s republic of china (prc). this cn code is given only for information.
(4) the product under investigation is certain ring binder mechanisms consigned from lao peopleâ€™s democratic republic (product under investigation) normally declared under the same codes as the product concerned originating in the peopleâ€™s republic of china.
(5) the measures currently in force and possibly being circumvented are anti-dumping measures imposed by council regulation (ec) no 2074/2004 [2] as extended to imports of the same product consigned from vietnam [3].
(6) the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence, that the anti-dumping measures on imports of the product concerned originating in the peopleâ€™s republic of china are being circumvented by means of transhipment via lao peopleâ€™s democratic republic and/or by assembly in lao peopleâ€™s democratic republic of the product under investigation. the evidence submitted is as follows:
- the request shows a significant change in the pattern of trade, as imports of the product under investigation have increased substantially, whereas imports of the product concerned originating in the peopleâ€™s republic of china have decreased following the imposition of measures, and that there is insufficient due cause or justification other than the imposition of the duty for such a change.
- this change in the pattern of trade appears to stem from a transhipment of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the people's republic of china via lao peopleâ€™s democratic republic and/or the assembly of certain ring binder mechanisms in lao peopleâ€™s democratic republic.
- furthermore, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping measures on imports of the product concerned originating in the peopleâ€™s republic of china are being undermined in terms of quantity and prices. significant volumes of imports of certain ring binder mechanisms from lao peopleâ€™s democratic republic appear to have replaced imports of the product concerned originating in the peopleâ€™s republic of china.
- finally, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the prices of the product under investigation are dumped in relation to the normal value previously established for certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the peopleâ€™s republic of china.
- should circumvention practices via lao peopleâ€™s democratic republic covered by article 13 of the basic regulation, other than transhipment and assembly, be identified in the course of the investigation, the investigation may cover these practices also.
(7) in light of the above, the commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to article 13 of the basic regulation and to make imports of certain ring binder mechanisms consigned from lao peopleâ€™s democratic republic, whether declared as originating in lao peopleâ€™s democratic republic or not, subject to registration, in accordance with article 14(5) of the basic regulation.
(8) in order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the commission will send questionnaires to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in lao peopleâ€™s democratic republic, to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in the peopleâ€™s republic of china, to the importers and to the associations of importers in the community which cooperated in the investigation that lead to the existing measures or which are listed in the request and to the authorities of the peopleâ€™s republic of china and lao peopleâ€™s democratic republic. information, as appropriate, may also be sought from the community industry.
(9) in any event all interested parties should contact the commission forthwith, but not later than the time limit set in article 3 in order to find out whether they are listed in the request and, if necessary, request a questionnaire within the time limit set in article 3(1) of this regulation, given that the time limit set in article 3(2) of this regulation applies to all interested parties.
(10) the authorities of the peopleâ€™s republic of china and lao peopleâ€™s democratic republic will be notified of the initiation of the investigation and provided with a copy of the request.
(11) all interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. furthermore, the commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.
(c) exemption of registration of imports or measures
(12) since the possible circumvention takes place outside the community, exemptions may be granted, in accordance with article 13(4) of the basic regulation, to producers of the product concerned that can show that they are not related to any producer subject to the measures and that are found not to be engaged in circumvention practices as defined in articles 13(1) and 13(2) of the basic regulation. producers wishing to obtain an exemption should submit a request duly supported by evidence within the time limit indicated in article 3(3) of this regulation.
(13) pursuant to article 14(5) of the basic regulation, imports of the product under investigation should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that, should the investigation result in findings of circumvention, anti-dumping duties of an appropriate amount can be levied retroactively from the date of registration of such imports consigned from lao peopleâ€™s democratic republic.
(14) in the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:
- interested parties may make themselves known to the commission, present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information to be taken into account during the investigation,
- producers in lao peopleâ€™s democratic republic may request exemption from registration of imports or measures,
- interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the commission.
(15) attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic regulation depends on the partyâ€™s making itself known within the time limits mentioned in article 3 of this regulation.
(16) in cases in which any interested party refuses access to or otherwise does not provide necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, provisional or final findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with article 18 of the basic regulation, on the basis of the facts available.
(17) where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made, in accordance with article 18 of the basic regulation, of facts available. if any interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially, and findings are therefore based on facts available in accordance with article 18 of the basic regulation, the result may be less favourable to the party than if it had cooperated,
an investigation is hereby initiated pursuant to article 13(3) of regulation (ec) no 384/96, in order to determine if imports into the community of certain ring binder mechanisms, falling within cn code ex83051000 (taric code 8305100013 and 8305100023), consigned from lao peopleâ€™s democratic republic, whether declared as originating in lao peopleâ€™s democratic republic or not, are circumventing the measures imposed by regulation (ec) no 2074/2004.
for the purpose of this regulation, ring binder mechanisms shall consist of two rectangular steel sheets or wires with at least four half rings made of steel wire fixed on it and which are kept together by a steel cover. they can be opened either by pulling the half rings or with a small steel-made trigger mechanism fixed to the ring binder mechanism.
the customs authorities are hereby directed, pursuant to articles 13(3) and 14(5) of regulation (ec) no 384/96, to take the appropriate steps to register the imports into the community identified in article 1 of this regulation.
registration shall expire nine months following the date of entry into force of this regulation.
the commission, by regulation, may direct customs authorities to cease registration in respect of imports into the community of products manufactured by producers having applied for an exemption of registration and having been found not to be circumventing the anti-dumping duties.
1. questionnaires should be requested from the commission within 15 days from publication of this regulation in the official journal of the european union.
2. if their representations are to be taken into account during the investigation, interested parties must make themselves known by contacting the commission, present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information within 40 days from the date of the publication of this regulation in the official journal of the european union, unless otherwise specified.
3. producers in lao peopleâ€™s democratic republic requesting exemption from registration of imports or measures should submit a request duly supported by evidence within the same 40-day time limit.
4. interested parties may also apply to be heard by the commission within the same 40-day time limit.
5. any information relating to the matter, any request for a hearing or for a questionnaire as well as any request for exemption must be made in writing (not in electronic format, unless otherwise specified), must indicate the name, address, e-mail address, telephone, fax and/or telex numbers of the interested party. all written submission, including the information requested in this regulation, questionnaire replies and correspondence provided by interested parties on a confidential basis shall be labelled as "limited" [4] and, in accordance with article 19(2) of the basic regulation, shall be accompanied by a non-confidential version, which will be labelled "for inspection by interested parties" and should be sent to the following address:
fax (32-2) 295 65 05.
this regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the official journal of the european union.
this regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all member states.
