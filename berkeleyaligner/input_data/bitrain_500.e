The principal repayments of Special Action Credits shall be made payable to the Special Action Account and the amount of the currency of a Member State so repaid shall as soon as practicable thereafter be returned by the administrator to such Member State. The Association shall not be liable for any shortfall in the repayment of Special Action Credits.
Until all Special Action Credits shall have been committed, the administrator shall keep the EEC informed of projects and programmes being prepared for consideration by the executive directors and those which have been approved by the executive directors. During the period of disbursement of Special Action Credits the administrator shall inform the EEC quarterly of the progress of the Special Action Credits and of the disbursements made thereunder. The administrator shall, as soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year of the Association, furnish to the EEC a detailed statement of the Special Action Account, together with an opinion of the Association's own external auditors of such statement. After the Special Action Credits shall have been fully disbursed, the administrator shall as soon as practicable furnish to the EEC a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed from the Special Action Account.
The administrator shall establish and maintain appropriate records and accounts to identify the contributions to the Special Action Account, the commitments to be financed out of the Account, and the receipts and disbursements of funds in the Account and repayments to the Member States.
The EEC and the administrator shall fully cooperate with each other to achieve the purposes of these arrangements. To that end, until the Special Action Account is fully disbursed, the EEC (acting through the Commission of the European Communities) and the administrator shall, from time to time, exchange views on the status and condition of the Special Action Account, on the progress of the programmes or projects financed out of the Special Action Credits, and on all other matters relating to these arrangements.
If this Agreement shall not have become effective by 31 December 1978, or such later date as may be agreed between the EEC and the Association, this Agreement and all obligations of the parties thereunder shall forthwith terminate.
If and when the entire principal amount of all Special Action Credits withdrawn by borrowers thereunder shall have been repaid and returned to the Member States in accordance with Section 8 of Article II of this Agreement, this Agreement and all obligations of the parties thereunder shall forthwith terminate.
This Agreement shall be approved by each Member State and the EEC in accordance with the procedural requirements of each party.
The Government of each Member State shall notify the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities when such procedural requirements applicable to it have been completed. The General Secretariat shall forward such notification, together with a notification that the EEC has duly approved this Agreement, to the Association.

AGREEMENT in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Settlements concerning the mobilization of claims held by the Member States under the medium-term financial assistance arrangements
A. Letter from the Bank for International Settlements
The BIS could conclude stand-by credit agreements with the creditor countries' central banks if they should so request.
These agreements could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid into the mechanism by the creditor country, with an overall limit of 2 725 million units of account, corresponding to half of the total of future commitment ceilings of the member countries.
The practical details of each stand-by agreement would be determined by agreement between the BIS and the central bank in question. However, certain conditions, which the BIS would be prepared to apply, can be indicated already:
The initial commitment of the BIS for each stand-by credit would be for two years with the option of renewal for other periods, the total not to exceed five years.
I should be obliged if you would inform me whether the Council of the European Communities is in agreement with the above.
Please accept, Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration.

On behalf of the Council of the European Communities
CONVINCED that increased international cooperation should be carried out in such a way as to contribute to the achievement of greater liberalization, stability and expansion in international trade in meat and live animals;
TAKING into account the need to avoid serious disturbances in international trade in bovine meat and live animals;
RECOGNIZING the importance of production and trade in bovine meat and live animals for the economies of many countries, especially for certain developed and developing countries;
MINDFUL of their obligations to the principles and objectives of the General Agreement on tariffs and trade (hereinafter referred to as "General Agreement" or "GATT") (1);
DETERMINED, in carrying out the aims of this Arrangement to implement the principles and objectives agreed upon in the Tokyo Declaration of Ministers, dated 14 September 1973 concerning the multilateral trade negotiations, in particular as concerns special and more favourable treatment for developing countries;
THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE PRESENT ARRANGEMENT HAVE, through their representatives,
2. to encourage greater international cooperation in all aspects affecting the trade in bovine meat and live animals with a view in particular to greater rationalization and more efficient distribution of resources in the international meat economy;
(b) promoting the maintenance and improvement of the earnings of developing countries that are exporters of bovine meat and live animals;
the above with a view thus to deriving additional earnings, by means of securing long-term stability of markets for bovine meat and live animals;
4. to further expand trade on a competitive basis taking into account the traditional position of efficient producers.
1. All participants agree to provide, regularly and promptly to the Council, the information which will permit the Council to monitor and assess the overall situation of the world market for meat and the situation of the world market for each specific meat.
2. Participating developing countries shall furnish the information available to them. In order that these countries may improve their data collection mechanisms, developed participants, and any developing participants able to do so, shall consider sympathetically any request to them for technical assistance.
4. The secretariat of the Arrangement shall monitor variations in market data, in particular herd sizes, stocks, slaughterings and domestic and international prices, so as to permit early detection of the symptoms of any serious imbalance in the supply and demand situation. The secretariat shall keep the Council apprized of significant developments on world markets, as well as prospects for production, consumption, exports and imports.
It is understood that under the provisions of this Article, the Council instructs the secretariat to draw up, and keep up to date, an inventory of all measures affecting trade in bovine meat and live animals, including commitments resulting from bilateral, plurilateral and multilateral negotiations.
Functions of the International Meat Council and cooperation between the participants to this Arrangement
(b) proceed to a comprehensive examination of the functioning of the present Arrangement;
(c) provide an opportunity for regular consultation on all matters affecting international trade in bovine meat.
2. If after evaluation of the world supply and demand situation referred to in paragraph 1 (a) of this Article ; or after examination of all relevant information pursuant to Article III (3), the Council finds evidence of a serious imbalance or a threat thereof in the international meat market, the Council will proceed by consensus, taking into particular account the situation in developing countries, to identify, for consideration by governments, possible solutions to remedy the situation consistent with the principles and rules of GATT.
3. Depending on whether the Council considers that the situation defined in paragraph 2 of this Article is temporary or more durable, the measures referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article could include short-, medium-, or long-term measures taken by importers as well as exporters to contribute to improve the overall situation of the world market consistent with the objectives and aims of the Arrangement, in particular the expansion, ever-greater liberalization, and stability of the international meat and livestock markets.
4. When considering the suggested measures pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, due consideration shall be given to special and more favourable treatment to developing countries, where this is feasible and appropriate.
5. The participants undertake to contribute to the fullest possible extent to the implementation of the objectives of this Arrangement set forth in Article I. To this end, and consistent with the principles and rules of the General Agreement, participants shall, on a regular basis, enter into the discussions provided in Article IV (1) (c) with a view to exploring the possibilities of achieving the objectives of the present Arrangement, in particular the further dismantling of obstacles to world trade in bovine meat and live animals. Such discussions should prepare the way for subsequent consideration of possible solutions of trade problems consistent with the rules and principles of the GATT, which could be jointly accepted by all the parties concerned, in a balanced context of mutual advantages.
6. Any participant may raise before the Council any matter (1) affecting this Arrangement inter alia for the same purposes provided for in paragraph 2 of this Article. The Council shall, at the request of a participant, meet within a period of not more than 15 days to consider any matter affecting the present Arrangement.
